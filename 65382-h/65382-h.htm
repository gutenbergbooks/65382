<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>Jangling</span> his keys on their big ring, the sheriff
led John McLean down several steps, then
through a long, narrow hall to the rear of the
jail. From a distant corridor came the sound
of a raucous voice attempting to sing one of the
popular ragtimes of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some fellow’s still got a ‘hang-over,’ ” observed
the sheriff as he paused before a cell,
consulted a number, then searched for the key.
As the door swung open a sleepy voice was raised
in mock solemnity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ho, varlet! Why dost thou open the
dungeon door? Has the king granted a reprieve?”
His eyes blinking, the inmate stepped
into the bright light of the hall. A dull red
suffused his pale face as he saw the tall figure
behind the sheriff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Dad! Nice morning,” he smiled in
a weak attempt at joviality, but the smile faded
as he sensed a change in his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son arrested in a low gambling den!”
the father said bitterly. “Donald, you have
disgraced the family name. Your drinking carousals
and gambling can have but one end.
I have been too easy with you. For your own
good I’m going to turn you loose. Until such
time as you can return to me rid of your bad
habits, and have proven yourself a man, you are
not a son of mine. I—I’m done with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s father turned abruptly on his heel
and strode swiftly down the passage. It had
been a tremendous test of his will power to
make this short speech, and to resist the almost
overmastering desire to take his boy in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man stood with mouth agape, a
stupefied look in his eyes, and stared after the
retreating form of his parent. The sheriff
broke the silence. “We’ll go upstairs, Don!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the upper floor the desk sergeant handed
the released prisoner his watch and money, taken
from him, as is the custom, the night before.
The sheriff motioned to a seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down. I want to talk with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald listlessly obeyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, boy, but I had to do it,” the sheriff
said in a kindly voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, Jim. There’s no hard feelings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” Donald admitted dully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much money have you got?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald stood up and drew from his pocket
a few crumpled bills and some loose change,
then threw out his arms in an eloquent gesture.
As he stood with the slanting rays of a late
December sun shining on his black hair, he presented
a wonderful specimen of man. Six feet
in height, of a deceptive slenderness, his rather
tight-fitting grey suit set off the graceful lines of
a supple body. His shoulders were wide, with
the gentle slope that denotes agility as well as
strength. His fine white skin and long black
lashes would have given his features an effeminate
touch but for the manly mould of his face,
with its square jaw, broad forehead, and deep,
wide-set eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff’s appraising eyes glowed with
admiration as they rested on the young man.
To the casual eye Donald appeared of slight
build, but his old friend knew of the steel-like
muscles of those arms and the strength of the
long, straight legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mind of the older man flashed back to a
football game in Donald’s High School days,
with the State championship at stake. Donald
had been sent into the game at the eleventh
hour, and with defeat staring the home team in
the face he had torn through the opposing lines
like a madman for agonizing gains until his dark
head flashed across the line to victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald came embarrassedly to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I guess I’ll be moving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, boy, take this,” the sheriff said awkwardly,
thrusting a roll of bills into Donald’s
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man’s face flushed. “It’s awfully
good of you, Jim, but I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, Don,” interrupted the older
man, summoning a smile. “I’m just giving you
a loan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald looked at him soberly. “I’ll pay you
back when—I—I—earn it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face very serious, the sheriff placed a hand
on Donald’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, listen, Don. Your father and I talked
here in the office for an hour before he bailed
you out, and we agreed that the best thing was
to let you go on your own. No, I am not going
to give you a lecture, for you are not wholly to
blame. Having a rich father is not the best
thing for a young fellow, but because you got
fired out of college should not make a husky
boy like you lose his grip. You just step out
and buck the line like you do in football and
you’ll sure make a touchdown.” He gripped
Donald’s hand. “Good-bye and good luck,
Donnie!” he added feelingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald crossed the street to the Hancock
House and sank moodily to a chair in the corner
of the lobby. His confinement in the jail and
the preceding festivities had robbed him of a
night’s rest, and he suddenly realized that he
was very tired and sleepy. Forgetting the change
in his circumstances, he engaged an expensive
room on the first floor and immediately went to
bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon awakening Donald switched on the
light and lay for awhile trying to adjust himself
to this new situation. Serious meditation, however,
brought him no nearer a solution of his
problem. A cold bath, followed by a brisk rub
down and clean linen, removed all the remaining
traces of his night of wild revelry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of John McLean’s break with his
son spread rapidly through the small New England
city. On his way to the desk to order his
baggage to be sent to the dock Donald was
beset by several friends who were loud in voicing
their sympathy. Extricating himself as quickly
as possible, he made his way to the elevator.
Quick steps sounded behind him, and, turning,
he looked into the smiling face of his boxing
instructor, Spike Ryan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Kid, how they comin’?” grinned
Spike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come upstairs with me, Spike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once inside the room, Donald turned to his
visitor. “If you start any of this sympathy
stuff I’ll hand you that famous ‘one-two’ punch
you taught me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sympathy be damned,” chuckled Spike.
“Dis is your lucky day. I come here to congratulate
you, to give you de glad hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why all the joy? Most of my friends seem
to think it is my funeral.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Donnie,” Spike said earnestly, “I bin
watchin’ ya pretty close for de past year, an’
ya sure bin ridin’ for a fall. Another year of de
way ya bin hittin’ her up an’ y’d have taken de
count of ten an’ be sittin’ wid de stew-bums.
Ya bin fightin’ an exhibition wid life wid soft
twelve-ounce gloves, an’ de both of ya fightin’
under wraps an’ pullin’ y’r punches. From
now on de fight will be on de square an’ to a
finish wid bare knuckles. De guy in de other
corner will hand ya some awful jolts, an’ y’ll
have to do some pretty fast work wid y’r dukes
an’ pins to keep away from de slumber swat.
But, Donnie, ya got de goods in ya. Nearly
four years in an engineerin’ course in de college
gives ya a better start than most of us guys. I’m
backin’ ya to win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seized Donald’s hand, and his battered
face filled with tenderness as he looked up
at his friend. “Good luck, boy. Keep a
stiff upper lip, an’ don’t forget that old
John Barleycorn’s a bum second.” At the
door he turned: “How ya fixed for kale,
Donnie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You get out!” smiled Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike grinned as though pleased at the rebuff,
and closed the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time after Spike’s departure Donald
sat lost in meditation. The philosophy of the
ex-pugilist, presented in the vernacular of the
prize-ring, had affected him deeply. “Ya bin
fightin’ an exhibition wid life, but from now on
de fight is on de square,” Spike had said. True
enough, he thought, life had been soft and easy
with him. But now it was going to be “on de
square.” His strong mouth set in a straight
line, and involuntarily he squared his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald left the hotel by the side door to
avoid meeting several friends who had gathered
in the lobby. He had an hour to wait for the
sailing of the boat for Bangor. Unconsciously
he walked towards the hill. An overwhelming
sense of loneliness swept over him as he stood
before his home, looming huge and white in the
bright starlight of the winter night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the first sound of his master’s step on the
pavement a big collie dog rushed forth and flung
itself bodily on the young man, whimpering in
sheer joy. Standing on hindlegs with paws on
his chest, he tried to lick Donald’s face. The
noise was apparently heard within the house,
for a shade was raised and Donald’s mother
peered out into the night. Silencing the dog’s
joyous whines as best he could, Donald crouched
low behind the hedge until the blind was lowered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, old pal,” Donald whispered, his
arms about the collie’s shaggy neck. The
dog turned slowly and unwillingly toward the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, within the house, John
McLean and his wife were discussing the possible
result of the father’s seeming severity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donald is a great trial to us now, John,”
said the mother, “but we must not forget the
happiness he has brought us in the past.” She
gazed long and lovingly at a photograph of her
son as a child; then, with head bowed, her lips
moved in silent prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon his arrival at the wharf Donald found
his baggage, destroyed the pass he had been in
the habit of using, as his father was owner of the
steamboat line, and bought a ticket to Bangor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reaching Bangor, he chose less expensive
quarters than was his custom, locating at the
Penobscot, on Exchange Street. In no mood for
sleep, he decided to take a stroll. Outside an
all-night restaurant was a long string of cars,
and from within came the sound of happy
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A feeling of loneliness, coupled with a slight
hunger induced him to enter. A big man sitting
at the counter, attacking vigorously a T-bone
steak, was the centre of interest, as evidenced by
the cluster of taxi-drivers and other night-lunchers
about him. He wore a wide-brimmed
hat, high leather boots, corduroy trousers, a blue
flannel shirt, and a red-mackinaw coat hung on the
wall behind him. Blond, sun-washed hair stood
up from his head aggressively, and his steely
blue eyes were set in a face tanned a brick red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” spoke the blond giant between
mouthfuls, “she’s a he-man’s country, she is.
None of your bum chow that I used to git here
in these Eastern loggin’ camps, sow-belly and
beans three times a day, and workin’ for forty
dollars a month from daylight until dark. No,
siree! Me for the Coast with its four bucks a
day. And talk about grub! Say, there ain’t
any hotel that puts up better scoffins than we git
in the loggin’ camps in good old B.C.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked around at his audience and,
convinced that they were interested, he continued:
“Yes, sir! British Columbia for mine.
Say! What’d you think of three fir logs that
makes a carload? Of cedars ten feet through?
Of alders that you can’t git your arms round?
Some different than them toothpicks you got
out there,” jerking his thumb contemptuously
toward the Penobscot River. “And minerals,”
he went on, “the mountains are filled with
’em—miles and miles that ain’t never bin prospected.
Prospectors comin’ in every day with
new strikes. And talk about fish! I seen the
fish so thick they choked the rivers; you could
darn near walk on their backs. That’s the
country, fellers. That’s the place for men with
git-up-and-git.” He finished his repast with a
gulp of coffee, fished a sack of tobacco and brown
paper from his pocket, and rolled a cigarette.
“A brand new country,” he ran on, his eyes
shining with enthusiasm, “that ain’t half explored
yet, and richer’n a pail of cream. How
much do I owe you, boy?” he asked as he drew
out a wad of bank-notes, peeled a bill from the
outside of the fat roll and threw it carelessly
on the counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep the change,” he said with a lordly
air, then swaggered through the door. Several
of the taxi-drivers followed, loudly importuning
him to ride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald finished his lunch and sat for a time
smoking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That guy was a nut to flash his poke in
front of that gang,” observed the waiter.
“Guess he’s big enough to take care of himself,”
he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Donald stepped out of the restaurant he
saw the big man across the street with four of his
former audience. From the shadow of a doorway
he saw the party enter a ramshackle building,
after hearing one of them promise to get the
Westerner a drink in spite of prohibition.
Donald decided to walk by the place, and was
startled by the sound of crashing glass and
indications of a struggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will, will you?” he heard the unmistakable
voice of the big Westerner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a bound Donald was at the door. He
found the Westerner badly battered, but holding
three men at bay. The fourth lay in a crumpled
heap in the corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only one of the men noticed Donald’s entrance.
He was a big, burly brute, with the
swarthy features of the Southern European,
and he came straight for the intruder, crouching
low. Donald’s left hand caught him on the
eye, and as his head flew back Donald crossed
viciously with his right. The blow landed with
an impact that sounded like a cleaver sinking
into a meat block, and the man dropped as though
shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rat-faced man, standing near a side door
with a bottle in his hand, shouted a warning as
Donald sprang to the Westerner’s assistance.
Both men turned their heads. The ham-like
fist of the big blond giant struck the larger of
the two men such a terrific blow on the side of
the head that the recipient whirled completely
around and sank dazedly to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Duck!” yelled Donald, as he saw the little
man’s arm go back. The Westerner dropped,
and not a second too soon. The bottle whizzed
over his head, bringing a shower of plaster from
the wall where it struck. With a curse the
big man turned, but the bottle-thrower had
disappeared through the side door. The remaining
thug, a tall, cadaverous looking youth,
took one wild look around, then bolted through
the front door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Westerner, gasping and rather pale, seized
Donald’s hand in his huge paw. “Pardner,
you saved me from a hell of a lickin’! ’Bout
two minutes more and.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grab your coat and hat and we’ll get out
of here before the police come,” interrupted
Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went through the alley to Hammond
Street, then down Exchange Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better come up to my room and have those
cuts attended to,” suggested Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Westerner touched gingerly the rapidly
swelling lump over his ear. “You know,” he
observed, “those fellers never intended to start
a rough-house. The little dip was pretty slick,
but I caught him with his hand in my pocket,
and when they saw that they had a fight on their
hands, they tried to lay me out with a billy.
Should have seen the funny look on that little
rat’s face when he lammed me with that loaded
stick and I didn’t go down. Guess this old bean
of mine must run pretty heavy to bone,” he
finished with a chuckle. He looked at Donald
curiously. “You sure handed it to that big
dago quick. How did you horn in on the row
anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald told of being in the lunch-room when
he had displayed his money, and of the waiter’s
subsequent remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh!” snorted the big man disgustedly,
“guess I need a guardeen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the assistance of the obliging night-clerk,
who furnished antiseptic and court-plaster,
they patched the hurts of the much-bruised
Westerner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the clerk left the room the big man
turned to Donald. “My name’s Jack Gillis.
What’s yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donald McLean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn good name,” he averred, looking
Donald over critically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I bin visitin’ my old home in Nova Scotia,”
he ran on. “Come down here to visit my
sister. I’m gittin’ homesick for the Pacific
Slope, and I’m goin’ to hit for B.C. to-morrow
mornin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m on my way to Vancouver,” said Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The effect of this statement on Gillis was
electric. “Do you belong in B.C.?” he questioned
excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald told him how his glowing description
of that land of promise had induced him to go
West, and that this would be his first visit to
the Coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” observed Gillis, “if I’ve been the
means of addin’ a man like you to the population
of B.C., then Jack Gillis has done some
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a real compliment,” smiled Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m goin’ on the mornin’ train,” remarked
Gillis. “I’d like to have you travel with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis rose with an embarrassed air. “Here
I am talkin’ ’bout you and I travellin’ together.
I guess you’re one of them tourist fellers, and I
don’t suppose you want to go along with a roughneck
like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald liked this big, bluff Westerner, with
his honest face and simple manner. He reached
in his pocket and took out the money the sheriff
had given him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see that? Well, before this money is
gone I’ll have to find a job. And it’s borrowed
money, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis studied him carefully. “Well, you got
my goat in a way, but there is one thing I do
know, and that is that you ain’t no slicker. I’m
’bout twice your age, and I knows a good face
when I sees it. I’ll meet you to-morrow mornin’
at the station. I’m goin’ to start callin’ you
Donald right now. And what’s more, Jack
Gillis is your friend from now until hell freezes
over. Good-night, Donald.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>Two</span> days later Donald and the Westerner
boarded a C.P.R. train in Montreal for the West.
They were no sooner comfortably seated in their
section of a tourist sleeper than they began
rushing westward through the winter evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The days that followed were full of interest
to Donald. The train roared West, running on
time like a clock. They tore through towns and
farming settlements and plunged into forests
and hills in the northern part of Ontario. The
hills dwindled when they reached Manitoba,
and in Alberta Donald felt as if he were sailing
over a vast sea of land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see them old Rocky Mount’ns pretty
soon,” said Gillis happily. “You’ll like B.C.,
Donald. And after you bin there awhile all
hell won’t pry you loose. I know, ’cause I
broke away from her twice, but I always drift
back. I ain’t got the eddication to tell you the
funny feelin’ I have when I’m comin’ back to
her. When I see them big mount’ns loomin’
up I feel sort of scrumptious inside, like I
wanted to smile at everybody, and I have a hard
time to keep from lettin’ out a yell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your power of expression needs no apology,”
laughed Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgot to tell you that I ain’t goin’ right
through to the Coast. The Company I work
for has a mill at Revelstoke that needs fixin’ up.
The job’ll probably last ’till spring. You better
stay off with me, ’cause you’ll find things on the
Coast pretty quiet this winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis had played the part of host from the
start, and Donald knew that if he accepted the
invitation to stop off at the interior town, Gillis
would insist on treating him as his guest. He
felt that his new friend could not afford to
practise this lavish generosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald shook his head regretfully. “I think
I’ll go through to Vancouver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis arose with visible reluctance as the
train drew into Revelstoke. “Well, I got to
leave you, pardner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald had developed a sincere friendship for
the man. There was a great deal of tenderness
beneath the rough exterior of this Western
logger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m pretty lucky in finding a friend like
you,” Donald said feelingly as they shook hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right, my boy,” Gillis replied
awkwardly. “I like you, and I’ll sure look you
up when I hit the Coast. So-long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was shining brightly as the train
rushed along the edge of Burrard Inlet toward
Vancouver. The lawns were a bright green, and
the breeze blowing in the car-window was soft
and balmy. Across the Inlet, that sparkled in
the sunlight, were huge mountain-peaks, their
tops covered with snow. The homecoming
passengers were smiling happily, while a look of
eager interest shone on the faces of those who
were strangers to the Coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald paused for a moment on the corner
of Granville Street while the cosmopolitan
crowd flowed past him. Stolid-faced Klootchmen,
dressed in flamboyant colours, with baskets
of clams on their backs, rubbed shoulders with
the haughty, turbanned Hindu. The little
brown-faced Jap darted here and there amongst
the crowd. A Chinaman came swiftly around
the corner of an alley, moving with a peculiar
trot, a pole across his shoulders, from each end
of which dangled a basket filled with fish and
vegetables. Another Chinaman, with a face of
true Oriental impassiveness, riding a bicycle
down the street, a clay pipe jutting from his
mouth, was extremely incongruous. The wide,
well-paved streets and the city’s general air of
modernity were impressive. In common with
many other Easterners, Donald had pictured
Vancouver as a rough Western town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald engaged an inexpensive room and at
once began a search for employment. Many of
the mining and logging camps were closed for
the winter, and work was scarce. He applied
to all the engineering firms in the city, but their
answers were invariably the same: “Nothing
doing until spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Days passed, and as late winter merged into
spring there was a stir throughout the city.
Men who had spent the winter in idleness were
“going out” again. Loggers in their characteristic
blanket shirts hanging loose outside
their trousers, could be seen on all sides saying
good-bye to their friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning Donald counted his rapidly
dwindling cash and found that he would have
barely enough to tide him over the week-end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With all his assets in the way of clothes and
jewelry in a pawnshop, he could not stave off
the inevitable, and there came a day when he
had not even the price of a meal. Too proud to
ask for a loan, he went without breakfast and
lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the logger’s employment agency he was
told the same old story: “Only men of experience
wanted. But,” the agent added hopefully,
“men are going to be scarce this summer, and
they will be taking on everything before long.”
Donald made the rounds of the engineering
firms where he had applied for a position, but
without success. Force of habit led him back
to the employment agency, where he sank disconsolately
to a bench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A diminutive man with blond hair, bright
blue eyes under shaggy brows, and his head set
at a cocky angle, entered briskly and approached
the wicket. “S’y, do you know where I can
find an ’eavyweight that can box a bit?” he
said to the agent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about those two I sent you yesterday,
Andy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one addressed as Andy made a gesture of
disgust. “Those two blighters were as ’eavy
as cows. They didn’t know their right ’and
from their left. I don’t want any ’uman punchin’
bags, I want a man that ’as a little speed.
Blime me, if I was in Austrylia I could get a ’arf
a dozen in ’arf a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m your man,” said Donald stepping forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small man turned. The keen eyes under
the bushy, light-coloured eyebrows studied
Donald carefully. “Can you box?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! Come with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald followed the sturdy little Australian.
For a few blocks they walked in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Ad your dinner?” queried the Australian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll ’ave a bite in ’ere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned into “Old Joe’s” restaurant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds good to me,” observed Donald with
a pleased smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Been missin’ a few meals, ’ave you? Order
what you want,” said the Australian, as they sat
down to a table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll warn you that I’m hungry,” cautioned
Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Op to it, me lad; about all we get in this
blinkin’ world is what we eat. What’s your
name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donald McLean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine’s Andy Pettray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Andy delivered himself of the following
information: “I’m the manager of Bill Hagin,
the Austrylian ’eavyweight. We are to fight
Slugger Garrieau, the Canadian champion, in
about two weeks. The Slugger is well named,
as ’e is an ’eavy ’itter and it tykes a good boxer
to beat ’im. I want an ’eavy man that can speed
Bill up a bit, and I’ve ’unted this town over,
but I can’t find one. Now, if you can deliver
the goods, you will be worth three dollars a
day and your eats. What do you s’y?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say ‘yes,’ ” was the decided answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy dug into his pocket. “ ’Ere’s three
dollars to bind the bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better wait until I earn it,” suggested Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right, me lad; you’ll be needin’ it
to eat on. I ain’t worryin’.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to the gymnasium at the corner of
Robson and Granville at two o’clock to-morrow,”
advised Andy as they stepped outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be there, and I want to thank you for
your kindness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forget it,” smiled Andy. “I’ve been flat
many a time myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half-an-hour ago I was broke and hungry,”
mused Donald, “and now I am well fed and
have three dollars in my pocket. Great old
world this.” He chuckled happily as he swung
down sun-splashed Cordova Street with a
buoyant stride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day, dressed in light clothing and
a pair of running-shoes, Donald went around
Stanley Park. Wishing to condition himself,
he ran the greater part of the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spring comes early in Vancouver as compared
with the East. In January the buds are bursting
in Stanley Park. The balmy sea air, scented
with earthy odours from the deep woods, seemed
to Donald to possess magic properties. The
blood sang in his veins. Overhead, big white
seagulls screamed and soared; squirrels retreated
in chattering fright as he raced down the road,
and over all was the sound of the booming surf.
The wind rushed past his ears, and he shouted
aloud from sheer exuberance of spirits and the
joy of living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald covered the distance from English
Bay to Granville Street at a jogging trot. The
air of the gymnasium seemed close after being
in the open. The big Australian fighter was
in the ring with one of his sparring partners.
The slap of gloves was like music to Donald’s
ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just in time,” welcomed Andy as he led
him to the dressing-room, where he quickly
shifted to fighting togs and then walked over to
the ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crowd of boxing-fans sat by the ringside
watching the big fellow work out. Donald’s
entrance caused a stir. His lithe, muscular
body was the attraction of all eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Op in,” commanded Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While an attendant was putting on his gloves,
Donald studied the big man he was to help
train. He would weigh at least two hundred
pounds. His shoulders were enormously broad
and square, and the muscles of his arms stood
out in knobs and bunches. His face was a
pasty colour, as though his training had been
done inside. His jaw was square and strong,
his eyes a mild blue, and his nose looked as
though it had stopped many a solid punch.
“Strong but slow,” Donald decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Andy introduced him Hagin merely
grunted. To the fighter Donald was simply
one more punching-bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald turned to Andy. “What do you
want me to do?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, knock the blighter out of the ring,”
rejoined Andy, with just a touch of sarcasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that?” queried Donald
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hagin came to the centre of the ring, assuming
an awkward crouch, his arms wound about his
face. Donald circled him warily. The big
man feinted with his left. Donald danced
within range, and the Australian let loose a
terrific right swing that would have felled an
ox. Donald side-stepped, jabbed his left twice
to his opponent’s face, and his right missed
Hagin’s jaw by the fraction of an inch. A
surprised look came over the big man’s face.
A murmur of applause came from the audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me pink! What a left ’and!” ejaculated
Andy. Hagin scowled and tried to bring
the fighting to close quarters, but was easily
avoided by his lighter opponent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald now took the aggressive. His left
found weak spots in the big man’s defence, and
repeatedly he sent in stinging jabs that drove
his adversary’s head back with a snap. Try
as he might, Hagin could not get away from that
whizzing left. It is a bitter pill to be bested
by one’s sparring partner. So far the Australian
had been given a boxing lesson. He forced
Donald into a corner and made for him savagely.
Donald ducked under the flail-like swings, and
shot a left upper-cut to Hagin’s jaw. The
latter staggered weakly to the ropes. Donald
was after him like a flash. Just then he saw
Andy gesticulating wildly and shaking his head.
Hagin lunged forward and Donald fell into a
clinch. The gong rang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the trouble, Andy?” asked Donald
as he reached his corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me lucky!” whispered Andy hoarsely,
“you’re punchin’ me meal-ticket. You’re
makin’ a blinkin’ boob out of me ’eavyweight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me to knock him out of the ring,”
reminded Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure I did. But ’ow the ’ell did I know
that you were a blinkin’ cyclone? Strike me
blind, a left ’and like that I ’aven’t seen since I
’andled Young Griffo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall I do the next round?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tyke a punch and go down—’urt your
’and—anything to quit. But for ’eaven’s sake
don’t mess up me ’eavyweight any more! If
the public ever ’ears of this our big fight is all
off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the next round Donald dropped to the
floor as they broke from a clinch in the centre
of the ring. He rose to one knee, holding his
hand and making a wry face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too bad,” sympathized Andy as he ordered
him to the dressing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Donald stepped from the ring he was
intercepted by a curly-haired youth whose brown
eyes sparkled with enthusiasm. “By golly, I want
to know you. My name’s Douglas Rennie.
My, but that was a wonderfully fast exhibition
you gave us!” he ejaculated, gazing at Donald
with undisguised admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald flushed. “I appeared fast,” he
explained modestly, “as I was against a very
slow opponent. I know nothing of Garrieau,
but he won’t have to be very clever to beat the
Australian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Garrieau is fast and carries a knockout in
either hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry for Andy’s man if that is the case,
as any king of a left will beat Hagin. Come to
the dressing-room,” invited Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later Andy entered and sank
dejectedly to a locker seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look rather blue, Andy,” observed
Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am. All ’ell’s a poppin’,” admitted Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve lost me ’eavyweight. ’E’s quit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Said I framed on ’im by sending you in this
afternoon. Said I ’urt ’is pride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pride!” echoed Douglas sarcastically.
“You’ve been treating him too well. I never
thought much of him as a fighter. You’re too
good a trainer to be wasting your time on third-raters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe you are right,” conceded Andy,
“but look what a blinkin’ mess I’m in now!
’Ere I am in the ’ole three hundred bones for
training expenses, and I’ve put up a forfeit
with the promoters for appearance. I’ll lose
the ’ole lot.” He threw out his arms with an
air of resignation and sank back in his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Andy presented a pitiful figure as he sat
hunched in the corner—his jaunty manner gone;
his blond head, usually held at a saucy angle,
sunk on his chest. Gloom, deep, impenetrable
gloom, enveloped this bright spirit from the
Antipodes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald knew now that for all Andy’s munificent
manner of yesterday, the three dollars to
“eat on” and the sorely needed dinner he had
bought had come from a generous heart, but a
depleted purse. Here was his benefactor in
trouble. How could he help him? He crossed
the room, sat down beside Andy, and placed his
hand on the little man’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Andy, take me on. I’ll fight Garrieau for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy came to his feet with a jump and seized
Donald by the shoulders. “If you’ll do that, me
lad, I’ll be your pal for life. Strike me pink,
did you ’ear that? I’ve got a real fighter at
last! ’Ooray!” The little fellow was in ecstasies.
“We’ll clean Garrieau up,” he went on
excitedly, “and then I’ll tyke you to the Stytes,
and then to Austrylia, and.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on,” interrupted Donald laughingly,
“looks like you intend making a professional
pug out of me. I’m doing this to help you,
Andy, and,” flushing in spite of himself, “I’m
broke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy glanced over Donald’s tall figure with a
professional eye. “You ’ave a week to get fit,
and ’as you ’aven’t ’ardly any weight to tyke off,
you should be top ’ole in that time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I work out with you?” asked Douglas
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to have you,” replied Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later the young men stepped
to the street. Douglas seemed loth to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come to my home for dinner?”
he invited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald hesitated. It seemed ages since he
had entered a private house. He glanced down
at his only suit, which was rather seedy, then
looked up, to find the usually roguish eyes of his
companion fixed upon him seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, old man. I hope I may have the
pleasure at some time, but I can’t do it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said you were broke,” began Douglas,
hesitatingly, “can—I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, I’ll see you to-morrow,” interrupted
Donald, turning abruptly and walking swiftly
down Granville Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas stood watching him until he disappeared.
“A mighty good sport,” he said softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fresh from his exercises and shower, his
cheeks red, his dark eyes shining with the clear
glow of health, his step springy and free, Donald
was a picture of rugged health and strength.
But for all this apparent outward brightness,
inwardly he felt rebellious. Douglas’s invitation
had brought a great longing for the comforts
of his past life. Why should he assume the rôle
of a pugilist to eke out an existence? Why
wear shabby clothes and even know the pangs
of hunger? Was it necessary? He had but to
wire his father that he was destitute and plenty
of money would be forthcoming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A big steak at “Old Joe’s” furnished him a
hearty meal. As he selected the money from
his meagre supply of cash to pay his check, Old
Joe bent his grizzled head forward. “Are ye
gittin’ short, son?” he asked. “Don’t go hungry;
come in any time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Joe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald was in a dark mood. He heard the
sound of happy laughter coming from a saloon
on the corner. There behind those swinging
doors was momentary recess from worldly cares.
He stood in the door of the restaurant and
looked across the Inlet at the twin peaks, known
as the “Lions,” which guard the entrance to
Vancouver’s harbour. The sun was setting in
a mass of fleecy clouds; the clouds became a
luminous gauze, and a golden splendour spread
over the water. The mountains were suffused
in violet, while the snow-fields took on a faint
stain of rose. Donald’s face glowed as he
watched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some country!” he breathed. He turned
to catch a friendly smile from Old Joe as he
worked over his range. “And some people!”
he added fervently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more he turned to the mountains.
The glow had vanished and the Lions stood in
bold relief against the clear sky. The massive
snow-capped peaks seemed to impart a new
strength to his being. “I’ll not quit. I’m
going to make good,” he said grimly.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>While</span> on his daily run around Stanley Park
the next afternoon Donald was attracted by a
horse and rider standing on Prospect Point.
The rider was interested in a huge white liner
ploughing her way through the Narrows, bucking
a head tide. The horse, a noble animal, with
full mane and tail, was restive, rocking and
prancing in his eagerness to be off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Donald lifted his eyes to the rider he
saw a beautiful, haughty face with skin of a
milky whiteness, a heavy mass of dark brown
hair, neatly coiffed under a trim riding hat, and
a pair of wonderful brown eyes that suddenly
grew cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shower of dirt and pebbles stung Donald’s
face as the horse was swung about as though on a
pivot and with its rider was off like the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A thoroughbred,” he exclaimed, as he
watched the rider until she turned a corner in
the drive. “Two of them! And she thinks I
am a low-down masher,” he added ruefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That afternoon he went through fifteen rounds
of boxing, finishing strong and fresh to tackle
pulleys and punching-bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy was joyful. “It will never go twenty
rounds, me lad. That straight left of yours
alone would stop ’im in ’arf that time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is my last day of road-work,” remarked
Donald to his friend on Friday afternoon, as he
slipped on his running-shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he and Douglas neared Prospect Point
Donald’s thoughts turned to the girl of yesterday.
“She was haughty as a princess.” Unwittingly
he had spoken his musings aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” queried his companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was talking to myself,” laughed Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad sign! You are either in love or old
age has overtaken you. Too bad!” Douglas
wagged his head sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may as well tell you,” confided Donald; “I
saw a Greek goddess mounted on an Arabian
charger here yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas threw out his hands tragically.
“Donald, my poor friend! I am afraid that I
hit you too hard in that last round,” he said in a
voice of mock compassion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald stopped short. “Look!” he cried,
pointing excitedly, “there she is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl sat gracefully erect on the big horse,
gazing down at the rushing tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be jiggered!” exclaimed Douglas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t blame you, but isn’t she a peach?”
said Donald admiringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas burst out laughing. “Do you know
who that is?” he asked with a peculiar inflection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you—a Greek goddess, mount——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my sister Janet,” interrupted Douglas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s mouth opened. He stared at his
friend. “Your <span class='it'>what</span>?” he exploded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I forgot! Poor fellow!” said Douglas,
solicitously, as his face assumed a mournful
expression. “I’ll certainly have to pull my
punches hereafter.” He leaned toward Donald
and placed his lips close to his ear. “S-i-s-t-e-r,”
he spelled slowly. “Does the old bean grasp
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut the comedy,” growled Donald as he
jerked Douglas to the side of the road out of
sight of the equestrienne. “Good heavens!
Your sister!” he groaned, “and she thinks I am
a masher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should she think that of you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald told him of yesterday’s occurrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is great!” chuckled Douglas. “Come
and meet my sister, Donald. I’ll tell her that
you can’t help flirting, and that will fix things
up all right. I’ll call her.” He grinned
facetiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you dare! You——” Donald warned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas avoided Donald’s wild clutch, ran
to the centre of the road and waved his
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Janet!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald shook an angry fist at his tormentor
and sprang to the shelter of the trees. There
was a thud of hoofs, a spattering of gravel, and
the sound of creaking leather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in the world are you doing here in
that dress, Doug?” asked Janet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Janet,” said her brother in a low, mysterious
voice, “I’ve got the fellow that tried to flirt
with you yesterday; he’s in there.” He pointed
to the bush. “The poor fellow is a confirmed
flirt; has it in its worst form. I beg of you,
Sister, be lenient, be merciful. He thinks you
are a Greek goddess.” He tapped his forehead
significantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald cursed the irrepressible youth’s sense
of humour. If he could have reached the
humorist at that moment he would have
pitched him into the Inlet without compunction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet eyed her brother with disapproval.
“What are you talking about, Doug? Have you
taken leave of your senses entirely?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will bring forth the erring knight for you
to censure,” rejoined her brother, bowing low
in exaggerated deference. “Ho!” he shouted,
“leave thy woodsy bower, Sir Don, the goddess
awaits thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seething inwardly, Donald tried to appear
dignified as he stepped to the road, but the
attempt was a dismal failure. How could one
approach anything like dignity when dressed
in a pair of running trunks, a torn and frayed
jersey, socks turned down over a pair of dirty
tennis shoes, and without hat or coat? All
this added to the fact that he faced a battery of
two big brown eyes, possessed by a lovely girl
immaculately dressed, who thought him a
masher. The greatest actor in the world would
fail to register dignity under such conditions.
He had a confused remembrance of a jumble of
words that went for a formal introduction. He
felt his face hot, and knew he was blushing
furiously, which did not add to his composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked down curiously, but not
without interest, at the embarrassed young
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald finally mustered courage to glance up
at the face above him. The deep brown eyes
regarding him held just a trace of humour.
The full red lips were parted to show a flash of
white, even teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a pleasure to meet you even under such
inauspicious circumstances,” stammered Donald.
He turned to glare at the grinning cause of his
discomfiture. “I would suggest, Miss Rennie,
that you have a doctor waiting at your home,
as I intend to commit mayhem on the person
of your brother as soon as you have gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet laughed. “I will go now to give you
the chance.” With a playful flick of her whip
toward Douglas, she was off like an arrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald turned to his friend. “I hope that
you are satisfied now that you have made an
ass out of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite happy, old dear. I didn’t find it a
hard job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald laughed. “I’ll race you to the gym.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the bout was to take place on Monday, this
was to be the last day of training. The fans who
had flocked to see Donald in his work-outs
admitted that he had wonderful speed, but
would be unable to stay the twenty rounds with
the formidable Garrieau. The verdict of the
knowing ones was that it would take more than
a snappy left hand to lift the laurels from the
champion who possessed the virtue of the terrible
punch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the boxer training is a trying ordeal.
The daily grind of road-work, bag-punching,
rope-skipping and pulley work becomes monotonous.
The nerves become frayed, and if the
weight has to be materially reduced the boxer
develops a bad temper and is anything but a
cheerful companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Donald prepared for bed that night he
thought with relief that the morrow would be a
day of rest. “I’ll be glad when it’s over,” he
mused. His meditations were interrupted by a
rapping on the door. In answer to his invitation
to come in, the door opened and a small man of
unprepossessing appearance entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visitor was indeed a most repulsive man,
of uncertain age, and with skin of a sickly yellow.
One eye was sightless, which he ascribed to an
accident during a football game. Those familiar
with his shady past averred that it was
caused by the vigorous application of an adversary’s
thumb during a bar-room brawl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Garrieau’s manager,” he said importantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” demanded Donald
shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, see here, Kid. We’ve got a dead
cinch to cop de change. It’s dis way. Youse
is a amachoor widout a chance in de woild to
beat de Slugger. Get me? Well, dere ain’t a
bit of sense of de Slugger beatin’ you up for
nuttin’, so we frames de bout. De heavy bettin’
will be on de Slugger, so we fixes it for de Slugger
to take de big flop. Get me? We let’s it
go ’till about de tent’ round, so’s to give de fans
a run for dere money. We gets all de money
dat we can beg, borrow and steal and puts it on
you to win. We puts up a slam-bang fight.
You can take de drop a couple of times, and
den down goes de Slugger. De fans will just
eat it up. De tent’ round will find you stannin’
toe to toe, den de last minute you sends home
de fake sleep-punch. De boobs will t’ink it’s
on de square. Den in a mont’ we gets a return
fight, and we pulls off de ‘grudge stuff’ and
we packs de house. Of course, we have to win
den, and all our money will be placed on de
Slugger. Dat means dat we cop de change
twice. Get me?” His ugly lips parted in
what he intended as an ingratiating smile.
“You come up to de club to-morrow and we
rehearses de whole t’ing. Get me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s face turned pale with rage. “I ‘get
you,’ you damned little rat!” he rasped. Seizing
the surprised Pursell by the collar, he jerked
him to his feet, dragged him to the door, and
threw him out with such force that he struck
the wall with a thump and fell in a heap on the
floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pursell rose with a snarl that showed his
yellow teeth. A look of bestial hate shot from
the one gleaming orb. “We’ll kill you Monday,
you——” The air was filled with the vilest
objurgations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Closing the door, Donald walked to the windows
and opened them wide, as though to rid
the room of the air his visitor had breathed.
“I never dreamed there was so much rottenness
in the shape of a human being,” he said disgustedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same hour, at the other side of the
city, Douglas was also entertaining a visitor,
but of a very different type. He had just
entered his room when he heard his sister’s
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I come in a minute, Doug?” Janet
came to the point quickly. “Who is this Mr.
McLean who was with you to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that was—er—Donald McLean,” he
answered evasively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what I mean. Who is he?
What is he? Where does he come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll look him up in Bradstreet’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do be serious, Doug.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it a serious matter, Sis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he is interesting,” she replied
hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I. I liked him the first time I saw
him,” said Douglas warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you haven’t answered my questions
yet,” persisted Janet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all his fluency of speech Douglas was for
the moment nonplussed. “Let’s see—er—what
was the first question?” He was sparring for
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t quibble, Doug. Where did you meet
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I met him a long time ago, through
an intimate friend by the name of Pettray.
McLean is his partner. Firm name McLean
and Pettray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is their business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—er—glove business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an interval of silence. “I’m not
a bad little liar,” thought Douglas. “I wonder
if she’s finished.” He yawned strenuously and
stretched his arms. “My! I’m sleepy,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet rose slowly and moved toward the door.
“Are you going to ask him out some time?”
she inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the door she turned. “Will you let me
know when he is coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, Doug.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, Sis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas stood for a while staring into nothingness.
“I don’t blame her,” he said aloud. “I
don’t know anything about him, but I’ll bet he
is a real man.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>The</span> arena and the grand-stand were packed,
the S.R.O. sign having been hung out at two
o’clock. The cosmopolitan crowd sat in solid
ranks, tier upon tier, from the select ringside
seats to the topmost rail. Judges, lawyers,
doctors and bankers sat with labourers, miners,
loggers, bartenders, and bootblacks. Men of
the underworld sat side by side with men that
make and administer our laws. There was a
sprinkling of Japs, Chinamen and negroes.
The turbanned Hindu made bright splotches of
colour here and there in the vast sea of faces.
Of class distinction there was none; all welded
as one in the love of the boxing game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The preliminaries were over, and the vast
crowd had settled in their seats. Suddenly there
was a stir, a craning of necks. Down the aisle
on the west side of the arena came Donald,
followed by Andy and the two seconds, the
latter carrying buckets, sponges, towels and
bottles. Donald wore a dark-coloured bathrobe
thrown over his shoulders. There was a murmur
of applause that swelled to a tumult as he clambered
through the ropes. He seemed cool as
Andy piloted him to his corner, but as he sat
down and stretched out his long legs, he appeared
ill at ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the crowd had given him a handsome
welcome, prophecies were shouted down
from the top seats that he would not last very
long with the formidable champion. Donald
was palpably nervous, as evidenced in the quick
turning of his head and the shuffling of his feet.
He looked slight and frail as he leaned forward
in his chair, the black bathrobe accentuating the
paleness of his face. A feeling of friendlessness
came over him as he gazed at the huge, strange
crowd who were loudly predicting his defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A well-known judge, wearing glasses and a
big black hat, turned to his companion. “It’s
a hanged shame, Tom, to match that slim boy
with a brute like Garrieau.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one addressed was one of the City’s
leading dentists and an ardent boxing fan.
“Don’t you believe it, Bill,” he returned. “Just
wait until you see this boy strip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here he comes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A roar of applause greeted the champion as
he came down the east aisle bowing right and
left in answer to their plaudits. His dark,
massive body seemed fairly to shine as he leaped
to the ring with easy grace and stripped off his
robe. He stood in his corner with hands on
the ropes, shuffling his feet in the resin, still
smiling and glancing about the arena. Evidently
he loved the limelight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In appearance the champion very much resembled
the ape. His bullet-like head was close
cropped. The small piggish eyes were deep
set under overhanging, beetling brows, and the
nose was flat like a negro’s. His lips were
thick, with a repulsive twist that gave his face
a sinister look. His massive jaw was purposely
left unshaved to rasp the tender skin of his
opponent’s shoulders in the clinches. His
enormous barrel-shaped chest was covered with
a thick growth of hair. His shoulders were
broad and his disproportionately long arms,
heavily muscled, terminated in two thick ham-like
hands. He gazed confidently across at
Donald’s corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pasteboard box containing the gloves was
tossed to the centre of the ring. There was a
stir as the announcer pushed his way through
the ropes. Andy crossed the ring to examine
the champion’s hands for tape and to test
thoroughly the new gloves for any trace of
sewed in shot or lotion that would cause the
eyes to smart. One of Garrieau’s seconds
was making a similar examination in Donald’s
corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A big man in a wide-brimmed hat, with a
mackinaw coat over his arm, came walking down
the steps of the arena. The look of astonishment
on his face gradually gave place to one of
joy. He ran to the ringside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donald!” he shouted joyously, as he sprang
through the ropes. With a thrill of pleasure
Donald held out his hand to Jack Gillis. The
big man’s face was beaming. “Just got in,”
he said. “Bin lookin’ all over town for you!
I come to the fight and—holy mackerel!—here
you are one of the fighters!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy noted the glad look in Donald’s eyes
and he spoke sharply to Donald’s seconds, who
were for ordering the boisterous visitor out of
the ring. The word “pyschology” was foreign
to Andy, but he knew that Donald’s mind had
for a moment drifted away from the fight.
Donald was surprised to see Douglas greet
Gillis warmly as the big man left the ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have two good friends in the audience,
anyway,” whispered Donald to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy leaned over him, talking in a low voice,
giving him comfort and advice. “E’ll try right
along, Donnie, to get your goat by cursing and
using vile language, but don’t listen to ’im, and
don’t lose your temper. ’E fights with ’is chin
tucked in the ’ollow of ’is left shoulder and ’is
neck muscles rigid. It’s mighty ’ard to land
on ’is jaw with a right. Now the first round,”
Andy went on, “you just jab ’im light with your
left; don’t ’it ’ard, just a good snappy punch.
’E’ll think you ’ave no sting in it, and the next
round ’e’ll get careless and let you ’it ’im so’s
to get in a punch. Of course, if you see a good
opening, let fly with all you ’ave, but ’e won’t
open up until ’e tries you out a bit. Watch the
dirty blighter in the clinches; ’e’ll foul you if
’e gets a chance. Another thing: this is to be
twenty rounds, so tyke your time. Now is
everything clear to you, Donnie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Andy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy patted Donald’s bare shoulder affectionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The contestants stood in their corners as they
were introduced. The referee beckoned them
to the centre of the ring for instructions. As
Donald slipped the enveloping bathrobe from
his shoulders and stepped forward, a murmur of
admiration swelled from the crowd. His lean
loins and broad shoulders showed to advantage
in the bright light. The long, flowing muscles
rippled under his skin when he moved, like
those of a panther. Loud applause came from
all over the arena. Garrieau, thinking the
ovation was for himself, turned and ducked his
head with a motion that was intended for a bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rough voice near the top shouted: “Aw!
that wasn’t for you, you big stiff!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The judge and the dentist turned and looked
at each other. The eyes of the latter seemed to
say, “I told you so.” The judge smiled and
nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fat man, who could not have been more than
thirty-five years of age, yet with rolls of fat at
his waist-line, a bulbous nose and florid face,
bit savagely on a big cigar. “By gad!” he
ejaculated, “that man is perfect.” There was a
look of admiration and envy in his red-rimmed
eyes. Thus do men admire the strong, well-kept
body of the athlete, even though their
own physical self has degenerated to mere
paste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two to one that Garrieau wins inside of
ten rounds!” shouted a voice. Douglas covered
the bet at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, men,” instructed the referee briskly,
“this is to be for twenty rounds. You are to
fight clean breaks. You can hit with one arm
free, but you cannot hold with one and hit
with the other. When I say ‘Break’ I want you
to break at once and step back. Do you understand
fully? Good! To your corners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald glanced at his friends, who sat with
their eyes upon him. He felt Andy’s hand upon
him gently stroking his arm, yet he could not
suppress the trembling in his limbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything’s all right, Donnie,” whispered
Andy softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gong rang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Garrieau assumed the crouch Andy had
predicted, his chin resting in the hollow of his
shoulder, his eyes seeming to retreat into his
skull under the overhanging brows. This was
the champion’s famous “fighting face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty boy, ain’t yer?” he scoffed. “I’m
goin’ to knock dose pretty teet’ down yer throat,
you——” he cursed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald snapped a light left to the ugly face
and danced out of range. The champion’s
thick lips parted in a fiendish grin. “My,
mamma’s nice boy has a terrible punch!” he
derided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald continued his dazzling footwork,
keeping the champion in pursuit and contending
himself with occasional left-hand jabs that kept
his opponent’s head rocking. He shot glances
at intervals to his corner for instructions from
Andy, who nodded his head in approval of his
tactics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The round finished in the challenger’s favour
by a wide margin on points. The champion
had not landed a single effective blow during
the round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The action of the first round caused Donald
to forget his nervousness. Andy crowded between
his knees and gently massaged his body, all the
while speaking words of commendation and
counsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that you find that you can reach ’im
easily with your left, watch me for signals.
If I see that ’e’s openin’ up, I’ll give you the
sign to shoot your left with all you ’ave. If he
swings again with ’is left, try for ’is bread
basket. You understand me, Donnie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easiest thing I’ve picked yet,” chuckled the
champion as he came to his corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may be stalling,” cautioned his evil-faced
manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh!” grunted the champion. “I can
take all he has in dat left and never feel it. I’m
goin’ to open up on him de last part of de next
round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gong rang for the second round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald caught a glimpse of Pursell’s face as
he crouched in the opposite corner. Such a look
of vicious hate shot from his one gleaming eye
that Donald shivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rough element began to boo Donald for
his running tactics. Some fans feel that they are
cheated out of the price of admission unless they
can witness the spectacle of two boxers slugging
toe to toe until one goes down. Science counts
for nothing with this small minority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whadda ya think this is, a marathon?”
they shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Powder-puff punch!” derided another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Garrieau suddenly tore in, letting loose a
terrific right that would have stopped the bout
right then if it had landed. From a clinch
Donald looked to his corner. Andy went
through the pantomime of shooting a straight
left. Donald nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Powder-puff punch!” again shouted the disgruntled
fan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did ya hear that?” hissed Garrieau, twisting
his mouth into an apish grin. “Yo can’t hit
hard enough to break an egg. I’m goin’ to
fix dose teet’ for you now.” He leered brutally
as he tore after Donald, disdainful of the belittled
left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald stopped abruptly in his flight and shot
a lightning left across to his pursuer’s jaw.
The champion saw it coming, but too late to
block it. He threw his body into reverse,
robbing the blow of a great deal of its force;
yet enough was left to send him reeling back to
the ropes, his head whirling and his knees
wobbly. With a roar the spectators came to
their feet as one man. The gong saved Garrieau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd gave Donald a deafening ovation
as he walked to his corner. He looked for his
friends and saw Douglas and Gillis locked in
an embrace and dancing madly in the narrow
aisle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty near got ’im that time, Donnie!”
cried Andy gleefully. “If you can get ’im to
lift ’is jaw off ’is shoulder, send in your right.”
Andy’s hands were shaking with excitement,
while Donald was cool and collected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go after him, Andy,” he begged;
“I can whip him at his own game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” admonished Andy, “keep on
as you are. Don’t try to swap punches with
’im!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Garrieau’s seconds were working over him
feverishly. Pursell leaned over the heavily-breathing
champion, his evil face sick with
apprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’d I tell yer?” he exclaimed. “They’ve
stuck a ringer in on us; dat feller ain’t no
amachoor! If he beats ya we’re both bums!
Foul him dis round, for de——” he finished
with a savage oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of the third round Garrieau
charged his elusive adversary like a mad bull.
Donald easily side-stepped him and he plunged
into the ropes. As he rebounded, Donald
landed a left and danced safely away without
reprisal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can do pretty footwork,” snarled the
champion with a look of Simian ferocity, “but
I’ll get you yet, you——” There followed a
burst of wild cursing. He tried to rush Donald
to the ropes, feinted for the wind, and let loose
a powerful right for the jaw. Paying no attention
to the feint, Donald ducked the blow and,
countering, shot his left to his opponent’s mid-section.
The champion grunted aloud, fell
into a clinch, and hung on grimly. The referee
pried them apart. Again the crowd came to
their feet to shout in a frenzy of excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Garrieau fell into a clinch, then wrestled about
until he placed his opponent between himself
and the referee. He loosed his right in a terrific
upper-cut that missed, but his left smashed with
fearful force to Donald’s groin—the most brutal
foul that can be delivered. The referee did not
see the blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s nerves quivered with agony. A
wave of torment and the awful nausea that
follows such a blow swept through him. His
face writhing with anguish, his gloved hands
clutching his groin, he crashed forward on his
face. His body twitched for a moment, then
lay still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd came to their feet and many moved
toward the exits. Another victim, they thought,
to the champion’s terrible punch. A number
at the ringside, who had witnessed the foul
blow, stood upon their seats and screamed
denunciations at the referee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The referee stood with one hand on Garrieau’s
massive chest. The latter was lustfully straining
forward while the fatal seconds were tolled off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The roar of the crowd came to Donald’s ears
like the dash of waves on a distant shore. At
the count of five his body stirred. At the count
of eight, his jaw sagging, his face distorted, he
struggled to his knees. He saw Andy’s agonised
face as through a fog and heard his desperate
cry of appeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up, Donnie! Up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the count of nine Donald’s benumbed
muscles answered the call of his brain. With
tremendous effort he staggered to his feet and
wound his arms about his face. The crowd
yelled themselves hoarse in tribute to his
courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Garrieau was upon him with a growl like a
wild beast. Donald stood in the centre of the
ring reeling drunkenly. Garrieau shot a terrific
right for Donald’s wind that struck his weakly
protecting elbows. The impact carried him to
the ropes, and he fell forward to his knees.
Again the referee’s arm rose and fell as he
counted the seconds. Again Donald tottered
to his feet to meet a fusilade of short-arm jolts
that pierced his guard and sent him staggering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gong rang. With body swaying unsteadily
and legs wavering, Donald walked to his corner
and sank down heavily. What a blessed relief
to lie and relax! His head felt leaden and there
was a ringing in his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His seconds worked over him in furious haste.
Andy knew all the tricks of resuscitation: the
upward sweep of hand on the midriff that
brings the big nerve centre to life; the quick
raising of the chest that brings air to the remote
corners of the lungs. With a sudden choking
in his throat, the little Australian realized that
this boy was very dear to him. A prayer on his
lips, his hands trembling, but sure and deft,
he strove to restore the shattered nerves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colour came slowly to Donald’s cheeks
and the haze cleared away as the cold water was
showered upon him. He felt his strength
returning. A long deep breath and he was
himself again. Youth and his fine body had
saved him. He looked across the ring at
Garrieau, whose vulture-like manager was leaning
over him with an exultant look on his face. This
brute had deliberately fouled him. A cold and
terrible rage swept through every fibre of
Donald’s being. He had demeaned himself by
entering the prize-ring. This was bad enough;
but to <span class='it'>lose</span> the battle!—<span class='it'>Never!</span> He looked for
his friends. Their faces, he saw, were tense and
full of misery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Andy, I’m going after him,” he declared
in a hard voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy was about to remonstrate, but he
caught a flash of the hard light in Donald’s eyes,
and the words died on his lips. He hesitated.
Maybe he should have let Donald take the
aggressive from the start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you strong enough, Donnie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s eyes held a dull glow. “Yes!”
he gritted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy patted his arm as the gong rang. “Give
’im ’ell, Donnie!” And then added reverently:
“May God give ’im strength.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald shot from his corner as though thrown
from a catapult to meet Garrieau before he was
fairly out of his chair. The spectators held their
breath. Was this the man who a minute before
had walked staggering and beaten to his chair?
When the referee pried the fighters apart after a
fierce mix-up in the champion’s corner, a puffed
eye and a bloody face showed that Garrieau had
absorbed severe punishment. Donald was everywhere,
dancing in for a fierce rally and out
again, always without a return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arena fairly rocked to the cheers of the
crowd as Donald stood in the centre of the ring
and exchanged punches with the champion.
Head to head they stood while Donald’s arms
worked with such lightning speed that the
champion’s blows were smothered. And, marvel
of marvels, the champion was giving ground.
The pursued had become pursuer. The tide had
turned. With his arms wound about his face the
champion retreated. As he assayed a lead,
Donald’s fist smote his face before he could again
cover up. Following relentlessly, Donald penetrated
his opponent’s guard with rights and lefts
until the champion’s face was a smear of red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bedlam of sound came from the audience as
they stood on their seats and roared their
admiration for the challenger’s wonderful exhibition.
Andy, his face set, his eyes bulging
clung to the corner of the ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Garrieau drove heavily at his elusive foe and
missed. The impetus swung him to one side.
For an instant his chin was without the protecting
shelter of his shoulder. With a bewilderingly
swift move Donald stepped forward, pivoted on
his toes, and with the full weight of his powerful
young body behind it, he whipped his right to
the champion’s unprotected jaw. Plop! Garrieau
fell upon his face and sprawled like a baboon
on the floor. Donald walked to his corner,
thrust his gloved hands towards Andy, who stood
as though paralyzed, and said; “Take them off,
Andy.” His voice was audible throughout the
arena. The referee rushed to Donald’s side
and raised his arm aloft in token of victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a roar the crowd came to its senses to
realize that the fight was over. Pandemonium
broke loose. A struggling mass of humanity
surged into the ring. Every man wanted to shake
hands with the new champion. Garrieau, the
possessor of the “punch” they had so much
admired, was forgotten. The king is dead—long
live the king! Such is life, especially in the
boxing game!</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>With</span> much difficulty Donald and his friends
forced their way through the cheering throng to
the dressing-room. Weak and tired, Donald lay
on a cot, while his handlers gently massaged his
sore body. Andy moved to the cot and stood
looking down on his protégé.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald opened his eyes. “Hello, Andy, he
smiled weakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Donnie,” said Andy huskily, as he
patted Donald’s dark head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s hand stole out to meet the warm
clasp of his friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some little fight,” said Andy, summoning a
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not bad,” agreed Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis pulled his hat brim down over his eyes
to hide his emotion. “I’ve a good mind to go
out and give that brute another lickin’,” he
growled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the promoters thrust his head through
the door. “Come and get your dough!” he
shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me lucky!” returned Andy, “those
words ’ave a pleasant sound.” He picked up a
small handbag and left the room. In a few
moments he returned, his face beaming. He
tapped the satchel. “Chuck full,” he said
happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the gymnasium they gathered in Andy’s
room, and for the first time Donald told them
of the attempted “frame-up” proposed by
Garrieau’s manager. Douglas strode across the
room and gripped Donald’s hand. Not a word
was uttered by anyone, but the silence was more
eloquent than speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all in a happy mood after the
prolonged strain of the day. Andy was in particularly
high spirits. “Gentlemen,” he began
grandiloquently, “I ’ave before me on the tyble
’ere a most wonderful little ’andbag. All it ’ad
in it this morning was a dirty collar and a shirt
stud. Now,” making a dramatic gesture, “it’s
the bloomin’ ’orn of plenty!” He turned the
satchel upside down and a mass of bills, coins
and cheques fell upon the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Ere, Gillis,” cried Andy, as he selected a
bill, “will you go out and get some champagne,
and when you goes in the bar buy a
drink for the ’ouse. Bring ginger ale for
Donnie; ’is manager’ll drink ’is share of the
wine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy sorted the money into piles and sat
quietly counting for a few minutes. “Fifteen
thousand and a few odd dollars,” he announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” ejaculated Donald. He was astounded.
He had given the size of the purse
little thought. “I had no idea it would be so
much,” he said in a surprised tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the boxin’ gyme is a great gyme,” said
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” remarked Douglas, “but after seeing
that bout to-day I’m going to take up tiddly-winks
instead; it’s not so rough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the big man returned with the wine
Donald turned to Douglas. “It seems that you
and Gillis are old friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, Jack’s been one of Dad’s right-hand
men for—how long, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About ten years,” replied Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m equally interested to know how you
and Jack know each other so well,” said Douglas
curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I met Donald on the train comin’ out,”
answered Gillis quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, boys,” cried Andy, “we’ll drink
to the new champ—to Donnie’s health.” Andy
held his glass aloft. “Boys, I can’t make much
of a speech, as I ’ave only ’ad one drink. Stand
up while we drink to our Donnie. I knows that
’e’s goin’ to leave me, and that ’e’s goin’ to give
up the boxin’ gyme. I knows that ’e isn’t in
the ’abit of mixin’ with the likes o’ me. I knows
that I’m lucky to be blackin’ the boots o’ a man
like ’im. But when I knows that ’e went into
this fight to ’elp a poor little bloke like me out
of an ’ole, I’m proud, boys, I’m proud! I’ve
seen many a fight, and I’ve seen many a gyme
man. But strike me blind if Donnie didn’t
this day teach me something about sheer grit.
When ’e came stumblin’ to me at the end of
that—that third round—I—I——” He stopped.
“You know what ’appened,” he continued in a
husky voice. “I ask nothin’ better’n to ’ave
’im for me pal. ’Ere’s to the gymest man that
ever stepped in shoe-leather! ’Ere’s to ’im!”
Andy turned away quickly to light a cigarette.
His eyes were moist. The room was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald was deeply moved by his little friend’s
show of feeling. Douglas broke the silence.
“You got back to the Coast just in time,
Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad has started on the biggest job that he’s
tackled yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember the big tract of timber
that he bought in the Cheakamus Valley?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he bought on my advice,” answered
Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he’s going to run a railroad in and
build sawmills, and saw the logs right on the
spot instead of shipping them to the Coast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” said Gillis heartily. “There’s a
wonderful stand of timber in that valley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But here’s the best part of it,” Douglas went
on eagerly; “Dad’s going to send you in to
cruise the timber around Summit Lake, and I’m
to go with you. It’s a wonderful country. I
was up there last summer.” He turned to
Donald. “Will you go with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be glad to,” assented Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” cried Douglas. “It will be fine
camping with you and Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Andy sat patiently listening to this lively
conversation, in which he had been completely
ignored. He could contain himself no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I s’y,” he blurted, “am I such a blinkin’
dwarf that you’ve forgotten that I’m in this ’ere
crowd? Isn’t me ’ead above the tyble? Where
the ’ell do I get off on this ’ere bloomin’ picnic,
I asks you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One look into the Australian’s seriously comic
face with its heavy blond eyebrows wagging up
and down set Douglas into paroxysms of laughter.
“Andy,” he declared, “I’m going to take you
along, even if we have to mark you ‘excess baggage.’
Can you cook?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I cook?” repeated Andy. “ ’E asks me
can I cook! That’s me first name; that’s me
profession. I’ve cooked on sailing ships, steamboats,
in camps, in the Army, an’ I did thirty
days in Sydney jail, and blime me if they didn’t
make me ’ead cook. I was so good they wanted
me to sty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re hired, Andy,” said Douglas decidedly.
“But isn’t it going to be pretty tough to quit
the boxing game for cooking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seein’ as you ’ave asked me I’ll say that it’s
a blinkin’ sight better than quittin’ it for tiddledy-winks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas came to his feet. “I want you to
meet Dad, Donald, and we’ll find out when we
are to start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy patted his stomach contemplatively.
“Well, with this ’ere champagne under me belt,
I think I’ll start in ’ere and ’ave a drink and a
fight in every bar from ’ere to Cordova Street.
About meetin’ you, Donnie,” he added scratching
his head reflectively, “the way I feel right now
I think by to-morrow morning you’ll find me
in the bridal-chamber of the Vancouver Hotel.”
Saying which with straightened shoulders, his
head set at a characteristic angle, he swaggered
down the street and with a wave of his hand
disappeared within the swinging doors of the
first saloon. In his present mood Andy envied
no millionaire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll like Dad,” said Douglas, as they ran
up the steps of the big office building. “He’s
rather severe looking and pretty straight-laced,
but the face he wears in the office isn’t the face
he wears at home.” He finished with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Rennie was the sole owner of the
Rennie Construction and Logging Company,
one of the largest organizations of its kind on
the Coast. He now rose from his chair and
came around the desk, all the while studying
Donald’s face, which bore unmistakable traces
of the afternoon’s fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad, this is Donald McLean, whom I told
you about last night. I don’t want to take up
much of your time; just wanted you to meet
Donald and find out when we can start on the
trip to the mountains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that Gillis is here to go with you, you
can go any time; the sooner the better, as we
expect to have the railroad to the summit in a
few weeks,” responded his father, his eyes still
on Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Dad,” said Douglas. “We can be
ready to-morrow and leave the next day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Douglas, will you please go to Bowser’s office
and get some papers he promised to have ready
to-day?” asked Robert Rennie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald moved toward the door with Douglas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, Mr. McLean, and wait until
Douglas comes back,” invited Robert Rennie
politely, as he pushed a chair toward Donald.
He then closed the door of the outer office, where
a girl sat pounding a typewriter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the older man turned his face was set
in a broad smile and he crossed the room to
seize the hand of his astonished visitor in a
hearty grip. “Man! man!” he exclaimed, as
he pumped Donald’s hand vigorously, “that
was a great fight to-day! When you got
Garrieau with your left in the second round
and that d—— gong rang, I—I—heavens, but
I was excited!” He was gazing at Donald with
admiration glowing in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—you were there!” gasped Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Rennie chuckled. “Top row—nigger
heaven! When that brute fouled you I think
I could have shot him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Rennie, I’m not a professional fighter,
I—I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tut! tut!” interrupted the enthusiastic fan,
“I can see that. By gad! that last round was a
whirlwind. That right you landed on his jaw—I
got so excited that I fell down between the seats
and skinned my shins.” He rubbed his leg
ruefully. “I never saw such speed as you showed
in that last.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here footsteps sounded outside, Robert Rennie
moved quickly to his chair, adjusted his glasses
and assumed a serious expression. “Not a
word to Doug,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bowser says that he told you he’d have the
papers to-morrow,” informed Douglas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” answered his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald turned as he was leaving the room
and saw Robert Rennie close one eye in a wise
wink.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>At</span> the breakfast table the next morning
Douglas was talking happily of their departure
for Summit Lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to hustle the work of timber
cruising,” his father admonished. “There won’t
be any time for play, as we expect to have the
road finished in a few weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry, Dad. This is my first real job,
and I am going to make good,” declared Douglas
stoutly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so, Douglas. As you know, I want
you to work your way up on your own merits.
I’m not going to show any favouritism. We are
going to put in a larger mill at Cheakamus, and
one at Summit Lake, so there will be good
opportunities for advancement for you and
McLean if you show the right spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Mr. McLean going with you?” interposed
Janet in a casual tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can he leave his business for so
long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not actively engaged in business just at
present,” explained Douglas glibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might ask him out to dinner to-night.
I am having a few friends in for the evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald accepted Janet’s invitation with alacrity.
Living within the four bare walls of a room and
eating in restaurants had long since palled on his
taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Formal or informal?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas made a deprecatory gesture. “Formal,
very formal. You don’t know Janet or you
wouldn’t ask that question. My sister is a
stickler for ceremony. How are you off for
‘soup and fish’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have the necessaries,” smiled Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald spent more than the usual time in
dressing. He stood before the small mirror
and surveyed himself with a critical eye. “Pretty
soft for you,” he apostrophized himself, “eating
in ten-cent restaurants one day and dining in a
millionaire’s home the next, and on the invitation
of the most beautiful girl you have ever met.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas called for him with his car and
whisked him to the palatial Rennie residence
on Shaughnessy Heights. The imposing evidence
of wealth was written in bold headlines on
the whole street of beautiful homes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Rennie met them at the door and greeted
Donald warmly. He could not repress a start
as he noted her likeness to Janet, and when she
spoke her voice held the same deep tone as her
daughter’s. She led him to a large room flanked
by two enormous bays that looked out on the
Avenue. There was a spaciousness in all the
rooms, a rare combination of beauty and good
taste in the furnishings, that were luxurious
without being ornate. Robert Rennie came
forward and gave him a cheery welcome. Donald
heard Janet’s voice behind him and turned to
gaze on a vision of loveliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet had dressed for the occasion with unusual
care. A dark red evening gown of a filmy material
showed to advantage the delicate contour of her
form and the graceful curve of her snow-white
shoulders and neck. Her lovely hair was wound
in shining coils and held with a comb that
sparkled with small but brilliant diamonds.
Her long dark lashes drooped, and she flushed
slightly as she met Donald’s look of undisguised
admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Rennie was an excellent hostess. Her
cultured and charming personality put Donald
quite at ease. It seemed ages since he had worn
a dress-suit and been entertained in a home of
luxury and refinement. After the coarse fare
of noisy restaurants which had been his, the
excellent food, the rich linen, the home-like
atmosphere and the subdued voices now gave
him a pleasant thrill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation during dinner was on various
subjects. At times it swung perilously near to
matters pertaining to Donald’s personal affairs.
On such occasions Douglas adroitly shifted it
to other channels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet studied Donald covertly. His perfect
poise, his air of refinement and his evident lack
of self-consciousness impressed her. “He is
cultured and well-bred,” she thought as she noted
his well-shaped head, his powerful shoulders and
his clean-cut profile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the finish of dinner, while waiting for
coffee to be served, there came a lull in the
conversation which was finally broken by Janet.
“Doug tells me that you are engaged in the glove
business, Mr. McLean,” she stated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald shot a quick glance at Douglas, but
his friend’s face was hidden in his handkerchief
to smother a sudden attack of coughing. In spite
of Donald’s great effort at self-control, he felt
a warm flush rise in his cheeks. What had
Douglas divulged? Did his sister know of his
participation in a boxing-match? He looked
at Douglas appealingly. It was evident that he
would receive no aid from that quarter, as that
young man’s only assistance was a prolonged
coughing that effectually drowned immediate
conversation, but would have to stop sooner or
later for lack of breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this crucial moment Robert Rennie came
to his assistance. “I would like Mr. McLean
to witness a sunset from our roof,” he said as he
rose from the table. “Let us have our coffee
served there. The light will be gone if we wait
longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they ascended the stairs Donald gave his
host a grateful look, which Mr. Rennie returned
understandingly. That moment cemented an
instant friendship in Donald’s heart for this
broad-minded Western millionaire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the eminence of the tiny roof garden
the City, sliced with streets, lay at their feet. To
the north the mountains were invested with a
mystic blue haze, through which towered the
snow-clad peaks. To the west lay the curving
white sands of English Bay, and beyond, in the
clear air of the long British Columbia twilight,
they could see the strong mountainous profile
of Vancouver Island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The topography of our City,” explained
Robert Rennie, “lying between Burrard Inlet and
False Creek, is very much like that of New York
on Manhattan Island. The narrows are deep
enough for the largest ship afloat, and the Inlet—a
veritable inland sea—has unlimited room for
docks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The name ‘Narrows’ seems a feeble word for
such a magnificent spot,” observed Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite true,” admitted Robert Rennie. “It
was only yesterday that one of our public-spirited
citizens suggested the name ‘Lions’
Gate’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dad, that would be lovely!” exclaimed
Janet, her eyes shining. “The ‘Lions’ Gate,’
with the two watchful Lions looking down on
all who enter. The name is most fitting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” concurred Douglas, “Canada being one
of the Lion’s whelps, what more appropriate name
than ‘Lions’ Gate,’ the western gateway to the
British Empire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Creator was wonderfully kind to us in
His allotment of mountains,” said Janet’s father;
“mountains that are not only valuable for their
scenic beauty, but for their mineral-filled rocks
and forest-clad sides. Our bays, inlets and
streams are filled with fish, and our climate is so
mild on the Coast that man can live in comfort
amid congenial surroundings the year round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here we have the last of the Great West,”
continued Mr. Rennie. “With nearly four
hundred thousand miles of territory, a coast line
seven thousand miles in length, our population
for the entire Province is less than one of the
Coast cities to the south of us. Here in this vast
untouched hinterland,” swinging his arm to the
north and east, “lies a potential wealth that
will support millions, a wealth that is awaiting
the magic touch of capital and settlers—capital
to provide railways; farmers to till the rich valley;
miners to unlock the vast hoards of gold and copper;
and loggers to fell the virgin forests. Some
day—and that day is not far distant—all this will
come to pass, and you young folks will see a
railroad from Vancouver to the Behring Sea.”
The speaker’s face was flushed and his eyes were
glowing. “Who knows,” he finished dreamily,
“but what the railroad I am building will be a
link in the Alaskan road of the future?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is a family,” thought Donald, “all
native-born, who have a deep and abiding faith
in the destiny of the land of their birth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Addressing Mr. Rennie, he said: “If the love
that you and yours have for this Province is
typical of the average citizen, I see no need to
fear for the future of your country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” the older man replied gravely.
“Our population is made up of people from all
parts of the world, as our native-born are few.
A cosmopolite is more or less indifferent to the
future of the country in which he resides. ‘Get
the money’ is unfortunately the slogan of many
of our business men, who make no attempt to
build for the future. Until such time as there
is ingrained in the hearts of our citizens a true
love for our Province; until such time as our
cities and towns forget petty bickerings and
jealousies and work together and harmoniously,
then—and only then—will British Columbia
become what Nature intended, the crowning
jewel of the British Empire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet’s guests arrived in groups of two and
three until about twenty of Vancouver’s younger
set were scattered about the large rooms. In
introducing Donald to her friends Janet felt a
warm glow of satisfaction as she saw the many
glances of keen interest directed toward her
stranger guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slender girl with elaborately coiffed golden
hair, looking like a white butterfly, fluttered to
Janet’s side and shook a reproving finger in her
face. “ ’Fess up now, Janet,” she pouted; “how
long have you been hiding this handsome man?
Who is this Prince Charming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curiosity killed the cat,” was Janet’s evasive
reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald had no penchant for social functions,
but this lively party was a grateful respite from
a whole winter of lonely evenings, and he
entered into the spirit of the occasion wholeheartedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A game of whist and then the big rooms were
cleared and they danced until a late hour. At
Donald’s request Janet sang for them. Her
rich contralto voice seemed to fill the room and
set the air pulsing with sweet harmony. She
sang a song of love and passion that seemed to
bear Donald into another world. As he turned
the final sheet and the last liquid note travelled
through the rooms he roused himself as though
from a spell. That voice! How strangely it
affected him! He looked down to find Janet’s
dark eyes fixed on his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you please sing again?” he implored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same?” she questioned softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. Donald’s gaze travelled from the
flying white fingers to the lovely face of the
singer. As their eyes met Janet’s face flushed
slightly, and at the finish of the verse she changed
quickly to a rollicking song of the sea. “All
join in,” she called merrily over her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Janet’s other guests had departed Donald,
Douglas and Janet sat for an hour chatting by
the large fireplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I go with you as far as Squamish
to-morrow?” asked Janet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, Sis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when the railroad is through I will
visit you,” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas looked at her curiously. Janet
abhorred roughing it. Riding around Stanley
Park and an occasional game of tennis comprised
the extent of her outdoor activities.
Douglas glanced at the clock and came quickly
to his feet. “I’d better hustle you home,
Donald,” he said, “as we have to be up
early.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tinted shade of the hall light lent a soft
radiance to the dark beauty of Janet’s face and
gave to her eyes a deep and languorous glow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have enjoyed every moment. Thank you
so much,” Donald said earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad,” she answered in a quiet voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her hand and held it in a strong
pressure. “I’ll see you in the morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she murmured softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door closed gently and Janet heard him
run down the steps to the whirring motor. She
stood immovable until the sound of the car died
in the distance, then walked meditatively to the
fireplace, sank to a big chair and stared dreamily
into the dying embers. Idly she reached for the
evening paper and spread it on her knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such dignity and poise! He is wonderful!”
she whispered aloud. “I must ask Douglas
more about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lowered her eyes to the paper, then came
slowly to her feet, a look of blank amazement on
her face. Smiling up at her was the face of
the man of whom she had been dreaming.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right95percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Canadian Champion</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“New Canadian champion, whose spectacular
defeat of Garrieau stamps him as a
master of fistiana and places him in line to
meet the world’s top-notchers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A pugilist! And she had proudly introduced
him to her friends! Why hadn’t Douglas told
her? She threw herself into a chair and gave
herself over to a period of gloomy contemplation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whistling softly, Douglas shut off the hall
lights and entered the room. “Not in bed
yet? You’d better——” he broke off suddenly
as she turned cold eyes upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you tell me that your friend is
a pugilist?” she demanded as she thrust the
offending sheet in Douglas’s hand. “In the
glove business!” she went on sarcastically.
“That may be your idea of a joke, but I don’t
see anything funny about it.” And without
waiting for an answer she flung herself angrily
from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas lighted a cigarette, which he smoked
with short angry puffs as he walked the floor.
He kicked viciously at an inoffensive footstool
and sent it hurtling across the room. “Damn!”
Then throwing the half-smoked cigarette in the
fireplace, he switched off the light and sought
his bed.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>In</span> spite of the late hour of his retiring, Donald
was up early and was the first of the party to
reach the dock. Gillis and Andy arrived soon
after, the latter staggering manfully under his
heavy pack, a rifle swinging loosely in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald stepped forward as Douglas appeared.
His face fell as he saw that he was alone. “Isn’t
your sister coming?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas avoided Donald’s direct gaze. He
leaned over to fumble needlessly with the straps
of his duffle-bags. “She’s peeved; saw your
photograph in last night’s paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” said Donald, obviously distressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Janet makes me tired,” said Douglas irritably.
“What if you did fight Garrieau? What
difference does it make?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your sister’s view-point is different,” answered
Donald gloomily. “You must be curious
to know more about me, Doug, yet you have
never asked any questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have often wondered,” admitted Douglas;
“but if you wished me to know you would tell
me. I don’t give a hang who you are or what
you are. You suit me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Doug.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shrill blast of the steamer’s whistle smote
their ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Ere, you blighters!” shouted Andy from
the top deck, “are you goin’ on this blinkin’
picnic?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lines were cast off, the water boiled under
the steamer’s stern. They backed slowly from
the dock, swung about and headed for the
Narrows. The scores of screaming gulls that
accompanied them hovered over the deck, their
keen eyes on the lookout for any bits of waste
food that should fall in the steamer’s wake.
Boats plied in and out, every kind of craft from
small fishing-boat to ocean liner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bright sun, beaming with all the warmth
and splendour of full morning, bathed inlet and
mountain in a wide shower of gold. A strong
westerly wind bucked an outgoing tide, the foam
of tossing wave crests flashing white in the
sunlight. The tumbling combers hissed and
crashed against the sturdy bow of the boat,
causing her to pitch jerkily. The salt breeze
whipped a glow into the faces of the party
gathered near the pilot-house and strummed
noisily through the masts and superstructure.
A yacht-like passenger steamer from Victoria,
painted a pure white, swept past them, a smother
of foam at her bow. A rakishly-built tug
trudged cityward with a huge raft of logs in
tow, a pillar of inky smoke streaming over her
bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they passed the sheer wall of Prospect
Point, Donald’s thought reverted to his first
meeting with Janet. Douglas, who had been
studying the shore through binoculars, passed
the glasses to Donald and pointed to the bluff.
At first he saw nothing of special interest and
turned to glance at Douglas inquiringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Janet,” smiled Douglas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, he now saw a horse and rider
on the highest point etched in miniature against
the dark green woods. Douglas waved a handkerchief,
and Donald caught a flutter of white
from the dizzy promontory. His mind was
filled with conjectures. Why was she there?
Had she still a kindly feeling for him despite
last night’s exposure?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet could not herself have explained her
reason for being there. She was up early, stole
quietly to the stable, saddled her horse and rode
to the Park. Riding steadily all the morning,
she had battled with herself, had summoned all
her courage to resist the spell this strange young
man held over her, only to find that her will was
impotent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she now waved her handkerchief she
strained her eyes in a vain effort to single out
Donald’s tall form. Suddenly a feeling of
shame for her weakness came over her. “Can’t
you forget him?” she asked herself irritably.
“A prize-fighter!” Whirling her horse about
she galloped swiftly toward the City.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The Rennie C. &amp; L. Co. were already operating
trains to Cheakamus, twelve miles from the
Coast. An engine with two coaches was waiting
to convey the passengers—chiefly labourers
carrying blankets—to “the end of steel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Cheakamus the atmosphere was tense with
activity. Engines shunted back and forth; the
scream of a big circular saw came from a mill
that was turning huge fir logs into ties; mule-skinners
shouted as they backed their heavy
wagons to the platform to be loaded with supplies.
At both sides of the track were huge
piles of ties, lumber and rails. The newly-arrived
labourers hoisted their packs to their
backs and set off up the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was plain that this settlement was not built
for permanency; it was a typical mushroom town.
The rough board buildings still retained the
colour of green lumber. Heaps of tin cans,
piles of waste lumber, and the various parts of
broken wagons littered the ground. The picturesqueness
that Donald had expected to find
in this wilderness camp was lacking, but he was
vastly thrilled by the stupendous power exhibited
in the combined forces of men and machinery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From up the line came the roar of a terrific
blast that made the ground tremble and sent
rumbling echoes through the valley. A whole
train-load of logs were dumped into the millpond
with a crash that sent the water in a hissing
wave that struck the opposite shore and exploded
in a seething mass of dirty white foam. The air
seemed charged with a dynamic energy which
caused the blood to tingle in the veins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the yard of a stable a number of horses lay on
the ground or stood weakly with drooping heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horse hospital,” informed Gillis, to Donald’s
inquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald moved to the fence, his heart filled
with pity. Two men, one carrying a rifle,
entered the enclosure and walked to the side of a
handsome big Clydesdale that stood on slayed legs,
his head lowered and his eyes filled with mute
agony. One foreleg was terribly swollen, and a
long, livid wound showed on one powerful hip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, Pete, but Doc. sez he’s got to go,”
said the man with the rifle regretfully, as he
slipped a halter over the stricken animal’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man addressed as Pete patted the horse’s
head affectionately. “I bin drivin’ old Bob
for about six years, Bill. We knows each other
like a book.” He pressed his face roughly to
the horse’s muzzle. “Don’t we, old pal?”
he finished in a muffled tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pulling and coaxing they urged the doomed
animal through the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t go, Pete,” said the man with the
gun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His companion stopped near Donald and stood
staring after the painfully limping animal.
Nearing the woods the horse stopped short,
lifted his head high on his arched neck, and
sent out a clarion call that was answered by
weak nickers from his mates within the corral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few men glanced up casually, then turned
to their tasks. Work went on as usual. The
mill clattered, drivers shouted, engine bells
clanged—only a horse that was no more useful
being led to his death. An everyday occurrence
in a construction camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a short interval the noble animal held his
majestic pose, then, swaying awkwardly, he
disappeared from view. At the sharp crack of
the rifle the man by Donald’s side winced as
though the bullet had seared his own flesh.
Brushing the sleeve of his coarse mackinaw
shirt hastily across his eyes, he muttered a curse,
then turned and ran with stumbling steps
to his waiting team, mounted the seat and
clucked gently to his four horses. The big
animals strained against their collars. The
huge load moved slowly at first, then, gathering
momentum, rolled swiftly up the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis brought five cayuses to the rear of the
station, and in a few minutes his practised hands
loaded two of them with their luggage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small cavalcade moved up the dusty
road in a single file, with Douglas in the lead.
They overtook and met numbers of freight
wagons, going in and out, the drivers shouting
greetings to each other in foreign tongues.
They passed the track-laying machine, which
was throwing the heavy rails about as if they
were matches in giant hands. Guards stopped
them without the zone of flying débris while
giant blasts rent the air as if some titanic monster
had torn the earth asunder. Huge rocks soared
above the trees, then crashed to the ground
with sickening thuds, while small pebbles spattered
about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the trees they saw a cloud of steam
and smoke. The air was shrill with incessant
quick steam-whistles as a huge steam-shovel
growled and tore like a ravenous monster at the
gravelled hillside. Four men bearing a stretcher
came slowly down the trail. A man on horseback,
wearing riding-breeches and leather leggings,
rode in their wake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, Doctor Paul?” greeted
Douglas. “Is it a serious accident?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tree fell on him. Broke both legs, and he
is hurt internally—won’t live,” answered the
doctor in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald glimpsed the face of the sufferer
showing ashen through a stubby beard. Bloody
bandages framed two crimson-stained lips, from
which issued gurgling groans of agony. They
moved on in silence for a few moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When people ride in trains,” observed Gillis
“there ain’t one in a thousand that knows
what it costs in sufferin’ and lives to make it
so’s they can ride in comfort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By mid-afternoon they came to the vanguard
of the army of workers, the men who were
clearing the right-of-way. At intervals they
could hear the long-drawn cry of the choppers
as the top of a giant tree shivered and then with a
great rending crash fell to earth with a resounding
roar. Here they came to the end of the new
road, and with a feeling of relief they plunged
into the cool shadow of the virgin woods. After
the great clamour, the forest, through which
the trail wandered deviously, seemed steeped in
primal calm. The roar of the blasts no longer
came in definite crashes, but was smothered by
the distance to a muffled rumble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rider jogging down the trail reined in his
horse and shouted a cheery greeting in true
Western style. He was a clean-limbed, alert
young man, with a frank smile, and seemed
elastic with the sword-keen health of outdoors.
He swung easily from the saddle and introduced
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Wilkinson. I am the District
Ranger. It’s getting a bit dry in spots, so I
want you to be careful about your fires.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Douglas told him the object of their trip
to Summit Lake the Ranger smiled apologetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My warning was unnecessary, then. I took
you for a party of campers. I’m following
the construction work, so will probably see you
again before long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mounted his cayuse, waved his hand in
farewell, then galloped down the trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The narrow path wound around the boles of
enormous trees towering high above them, some
of the tallest being nearly two hundred feet in
height. Gillis appraised them with a critical
eye. He was thinking of them as logs, calculated
in terms of board feet, but over Donald their
beauty and nobility cast a strange spell. How
long had these monarchs enjoyed the repose so
soon to be broken by puny man? Probably
some of them were good-sized trees when
Columbus discovered America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The solemnity of the forest was at times
broken by the sharp “ka-a-a-a-a-h” of startled
deer as they caught their scent, or the sudden
hum of wings as big blue-grouse shot up from
their path. Once the horses pricked their ears
and snorted in fear as a bear crashed his way
through the deep woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As daylight abandoned the forest and twilight
made eerie shadows on the dusky trail, they swung
to an open space on the banks of the roaring
Cheakamus River, and made camp for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At daybreak they began the upward climb,
and by noon felt the buoyancy of the air in the
higher altitude. They crossed rushing streams
and skirted the shores of small lakes on whose
waters rested flocks of ducks in gregarious
raft-like formations. The cayuses with their
enormous packs showed signs of fatigue, and
Gillis called frequent halts as the trail grew
gradually steeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are nearly there,” cried Douglas eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later they topped a heavily-wooded
hill and swung in to a narrow path on
their right. There was no need to guide the
horses, as they knew that here were rest and
food for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sudden quickening along the
line. Donald’s horse broke into a run, with
Andy’s close behind, the latter holding to the rear
of his saddle and making a wry face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I knew ’ow to keep this ’ere blinkin’
saddle from comin’ up and hittin’ me in the seat,”
said Andy querulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald reined in his eager horse as they
emerged from the woods and an enchanting
scene burst on his view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This blinkin’ ’orse is.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Andy stopped
as his gaze followed Donald’s. Both sat
spell-bound, and the others joined them quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The panorama spread before them was singularly
wild and impressive. Below them stretched
a lake of emerald hue, rippled here and there
by occasional cat’s-paws, but for the most part,
placid enough to reflect the shores with mirror-like
clearness. To their right lay an open valley,
through which ran a crystal clear mountain
stream, its banks fringed with willow, alder and
cottonwood, with frequent splashes of the early
blooming labrador tea. A rustic bridge of logs
crossed the rushing stream to a cluster of well-built
log cabins that were fenced in by a palisade
of cedar posts. Inside the enclosure a patch
of freshly ploughed soil stood out rich and dark
against the carpet of green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under an azure sky, dotted with fleecy clouds,
a brilliantly white sky-line of ice-covered mountains,
whose peaks flashed in the setting sun,
circled this beautiful mountain valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From below were wafted the odours of an
awakening earth. The sweet perfume of the
newly-opened and sticky buds of the balm-of-gilead,
the delicious aroma of the spruce and pine,
the heavy, sweet smell of the water plants and
the white orchis; all this fragrance was borne on
the crisp, sparkling mountain air. Involuntarily
the travellers filled their lungs with this
life-giving atmosphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A beautiful gold-eye drake and his drab-coloured
mate swam along the shore in search
of a safe place to nest. From the centre of the
lake a loon sent out its weird cry, echoing and
re-echoing from the wooded hills like wild,
demoniacal laughter. A quick rush of wings
overhead, then a mallard duck struck the water
with a loud splash and immediately set up a
sustained quacking until answered by a more
gentle note from the reeds, whence emerged a
hen-mallard. The two met amid a great bobbing
of heads. Gabbling in an undertone
they swam down the lake together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The elusive hooting of male blue-grouse came
from the tree-tops of the rocky slopes. A
willow grouse moved from a clump of bushes
with a haughty step to show her finery by
ruffling the feathers of her neck and spreading
her fan-like tail. There was a sharp “plop”
as a rainbow trout curved gracefully on the
surface to leave a widening circle of ripples on
the calm water. All through this sun-washed
valley was the soft murmur of a land at peace—at
peace because unspoiled by man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me pink!” breathed Andy in an awed
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy mackerel! but ain’t she a pretty
spot?” came excitedly from Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they rumbled across the bridge a man
came to the door of the log cabin, ran swiftly
to the fence and swung the gate open. With
a hand held to his brow to shade his eyes from
the slanting rays of the setting sun, he peered
up at the horsemen. His eyes lighted up as he
recognized Douglas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, ol’ timer!” he shouted cheerily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Hillier filled the dual rôle of trapper and
road-house keeper. His fantastic dress of deerskin,
the six-shooter slung at his hip, and the
big sombrero that topped his shaggy grey head
gave him almost a sinister appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old John’s face was savage and wild, but his
bristly moustache hid a mouth as tender as a
woman’s. Great shaggy brows beetling out over
his grey mountaineer eyes could not conceal
the softness that crept into them so often.
His gentle eyes seemed out of place in that
homely, battle-scarred face. It was like finding
a touch of romance in a treatise on trigonometry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was known under several sobriquets:
“Trapper” John, “Coffee” John, and “Mahogany”
John. “Coffee” John for the excellence
of his brew of that beverage, and of which he
drank enormous quantities. His call to meals:
“Come and throw your feet under the mahogany,”
supplied the reason for the cognomen of
“Mahogany” John.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the assistance of their host they unsaddled
the tired horses and turned them into the pasture,
where they rolled luxuriously on their backs
for a moment, and then started feeding hungrily
on the rich clover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wind shook the tree-tops and turned the
surface of the lake dark with ripples. High
in air, streaming dark clouds scudded swiftly
by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got here jest in time,” said the old trapper,
as he looked up at the sky. “It’s a goin’ to
rain. Come inside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John had served as cook in a cowboy camp
in Texas. He never overlooked an opportunity
to make ostentatious display of his skill in the
culinary art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jest set my bread this mornin’,” he explained,
“so I’ll hev’ ter make a bannock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking a tin pan from the shelf, he threw it
the full length of the room to the table. He
tossed the cooking utensils about like a practised
juggler. Soon the bannock swelled to the rim
of the frying-pan, the edges showing brown and
crisp. He lifted the heavy dish from the stove,
and with a dexterous twist of his wrist threw the
bannock to the ceiling and caught it neatly in
the centre of the pan as it came down. He
dipped a half dozen trout in the yolk of eggs,
rolled them in flour, then tossed them with
apparent carelessness, but with deadly aim, one
at a time, to the sizzling pan. From a shelf he
took two glass jars and turned their contents into
an earthenware dish on the stove. Immediately
the room was filled with an aroma that caused
the newcomers to sniff hungrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Hillier,” began Andy, “what.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Hillier! Hell! My name’s John,”
exploded the trapper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was goin’ to ask you what kind o’ meat
that is that smells so good,” grinned Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muskrat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muskrat,” repeated their host, turning to the
astonished Australian. “Did ye ever eat any?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” returned Andy weakly, “I don’t care
much for meat anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re darn good eatin’,” affirmed the
trapper. “Reason folks won’t try ’em is because
they think that they are a rat. Their
right name is musquash, and they live on vegetable
food only. Did any of you fellers ever see
‘Diamond Back Terrapin’ on a bill-of-fare in
restaurants?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have, many times,” answered Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, ’bout half the time when the waiter
hands ye what ye think is turtle he’s givin’ you
musquash,” stated the trapper as he speared a
cube of butter with a long fork and shot it
accurately to the debated dish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy laughed outright. “Strike me fair,
John, you’ve got anythin’ I ever see beat a block
for slingin’ grub.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John was pleased. “Oh, I’m fair to middlin’
good,” he admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John served the dinner in the pots and pans
in which the food had been cooked, and piled
the table with enough to serve a dozen men.
“Like to see lots of grub in sight,” smiled the
old trapper. He placed a big steaming coffeepot
in the centre of the table, and then sent out
his original dinner-call. “Throw your feet
under the mahogany!” he roared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party needed no second call. The mountain
air had given them wolfish appetites and they
made huge inroads on the trapper’s well-cooked
dinner. With the exception of Andy, they ate
and enjoyed the musquash; the meat being fine-grained
and tender. John was visibly disappointed
by Andy’s refusal to try this delicacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try it, ol’ timer,” he insisted, as he pushed
the steaming pan across the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy made a wry face. “Don’t feel jest
hungry to-night,” he mumbled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner finished, Donald pushed back his
chair and lighted a cigarette. “John, that was
a dandy meal, and your coffee sure is a nectar
fit for the gods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trapper was justly proud of his cooking.
Donald’s praise brought a deeper tinge of colour
to his bronzed face. He refilled the tin cups
and they sat quietly smoking and sipping the
fragrant coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the day in the open and the excellent
meal it was pleasant to sit in the genial warmth
of the cabin while the storm which had been
gathering broke overhead and the incessant
patter of rain sounded on the roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between Andy and John there sprang up a
comradeship based on the peculiar brotherhood
which often exists between small men. Each
found in the other traits that amused him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Comical little duck,” was John’s opinion of
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me pink! He’s the funniest old
geezer that I ever saw in me life,” Andy confided
to Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together they washed the dishes and tidied
up the room. When they had finished Andy
dragged in his duffle-bag, rummaged through
the contents, and produced a flask of rum. The
trapper’s face brightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I brought this for medicinal purposes,”
stated Andy. “How are you feelin’, John?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mirth wrinkles around the trapper’s eyes
deepened. “My misery is purty bad to-night,
ol’ timer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy poured liberally into a tin cup. The
pungent odour of rum filled the room. Old
John sniffed the contents. “Whuff!” he
yowled, “good licker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old trapper, standing in the centre of the
room, presented a figure wild and strange. His
coat of buckskin was open at the throat to expose
a hairy chest. His mane-like mass of wiry hair
stood straight out and shook with every movement
of his body. A veritable wild man of the
woods he looked as he grasped the cup and held
it up to his admiring gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The storm had reached the height of its fury.
The wind roared and moaned like a famished
wild thing denied its kill. Occasionally a venturesome
gust would find its way down the
chimney to send thin puffs of smoke to linger in
the air and fill the cabin with the sweet perfume
of the burning alder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give us a toast, John,” begged Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trapper raised his cup on high:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I’m the trapper of the mount’n top,</p>
<p class='line0'>A ring-tail-snorter an’ a dead-sure shot.</p>
<p class='line0'>I’m wild, I’m woolly an’ full o’ fleas,</p>
<p class='line0'>I’ve never bin’ curried below the knees,</p>
<p class='line0'>I live on the fruit o’ the prickly pear,</p>
<p class='line0'>An’ I play in the brush with the grizzly bear.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s hopin’ ye’ll never see the back o’ yer
neck,” he added. Then placing the cup to his
lips he drained the contents with one great gulp.
John’s jaws were well-nigh toothless, and as the
fiery liquor scorched his throat his leathery cheeks
folded and unfolded like the pleats of an accordion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wow!” he yelped, “she’s sure got a kick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The humorous toast and the trapper’s facial
contortions sent Andy into paroxysms of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me blind!” he gasped, as he held his
sides. “I never——” His eyes rested again
on the trapper’s convulsed features. Speech
failed him and he sank writhing to a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When finally they climbed the ladder to their
bunks the rain had ceased and a brilliant moon
flooded the valley with a white light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald awakened as the first grey streaks of
dawn brightened the dusty windows of the loft.
The air was suddenly filled with the sweet song
of birds. Wild-fowl quacked and splashed in
the waters of the lake. The aroma of coffee and
frying bacon and the pungent odour of wood
smoke was wafted strongly from below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the trapper’s shaggy head protruded
through the opening at the top of the ladder.
“Get out o’ the hay an’ let the sun shine on
ye!” he boomed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, let’s get busy,” said Gillis, when
breakfast was over. “The first thing to do is
to find a good spot to pitch our tent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll find a deserted cabin at t’other end
o’ the lake that’ll be a whole lot more comfortable
nor a tent,” informed the trapper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cabin of cedar logs proved to be in good
repair and the location excellent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A couple of days’ work,” observed Gillis,
“an’ I can fix her up so’s we’ll be as snug as a
bug in a rug.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John had spent the forenoon in baking.
Cakes, pies, doughnuts and cookies were placed
at regular intervals on the shelves in platters
and tins tipped at an angle to make the display
more effective. It was an exhibit of pastry that
any housewife might envy. The unstinted
praise of his guests was like music to the trapper’s
ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For dessert they had a savoury mince-pie,
steaming hot from the oven. Andy waxed most
eloquent in his praise of this culinary delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have another piece, ol’ timer,” insisted John,
his face beaming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet I will,” was Andy’s quick response
as he transferred a big slice to his plate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like it, do ye?” asked John.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“U-m-m,” mumbled Andy as he devoured the
last crumb and settled back with a sigh of content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John’s wrinkled old face spread into a wide
grin. From his lips came a cackling laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the joke?” queried Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I’d get that muskrat into ye somehow,”
chortled the trapper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s not so durned bad, after all,”
philosophized Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the third day after their arrival they moved
to the cabin at the head of the lake. There
followed days of arduous toil, days spent in
“blazing” lines through almost impassable
swales, up steep hillsides and through canyons.
Days of strenuous exercise in the stimulating
air, when the bright sunshine tanned their faces
to a deep brown, brought the glow of perfect
health to their eyes, and gave to their muscles
the resiliency and strength of steel springs.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>One</span> calm Sunday morning Donald paddled
across the lake to try the fly at the mouth of
the small creek which flowed past the trapper’s
cabin. The clear water was as smooth as glass
and the trout refused to be lured from the depths.
After casting steadily for fifteen minutes without
a rise, he sat down to enjoy a smoke. Sounds
from afar came with surprising clearness through
the quiet air. Andy was splitting wood outside
the cabin door, and the sound of his axe and
the words of his song brought a medley of
returning echoes. Loons gabbled, wild ducks of
many varieties shifted their positions with a
whistling rush of wings. The “chee-ry, chee-ry”
of a flock of chickadees sounded from a copse of
willows on the creek bank. The warmth of the
morning gave promise of a hot day when the
sun should reach the zenith. A breath of cool
air rippled the lake’s surface, bringing with it
the faint rumble of a waterfall high up the
mountain-side. Donald paddled to the shore,
crossed the rustic bridge to where the trapper
was working in his garden, and sat down on a
convenient stump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, John.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mornin’, ol’ timer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John, is there a waterfall on the big creek?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’ve heard ’em, an’ I’ve seen ’em from
the ridge, but I ain’t ever bin close to ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think there would be any fish at the
foot of the falls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t say, ol’ timer. It ain’t never bin
fished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the disciples of Isaac Walton the expression
“never been fished” brings an incomparable
thrill. To cast a fly on virgin waters is
the acme of bliss to an angler. Donald unjointed
his rod, slung his basket over a shoulder
and started toward the trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye better let me fix ye up a lunch to take
along,” the trapper shouted after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good suggestion,” admitted Donald as he
retraced his steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fried eggs placed between slices of snow-white
bread, fresh doughnuts, cake and cheese were
quickly prepared by the deft hands of the old
trapper, and Donald was again on his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to follow the stream, but the sides
were so precipitous that he was forced to climb
to the ridge or “hog-back.” Here he found the
walking excellent, as there was no under-brush
and the ground was covered with a soft moss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At intervals through the park-like pines he
caught the glint of running water in the gorge
below. The air was warm, but the gentle
zephyrs wafted from the glacial stream brought
a coolness that was almost chill. The sound of
the falls became louder as he climbed higher,
increasing to a trembling roar as he came to
the edge of a boulder-strewn precipice. Here
there met his gaze a tumbling cascade of water,
falling from a cliff to an iridescent pool sixty
feet below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald scrambled and slid to the lower level,
only to find that he would have to walk down
stream and wade up in order to get within reach
of the pool. By leaping from rock to rock he
managed to reach a flat ledge near the side that
allowed him perfect freedom for casting. The
spray reached him in the form of a fine mist
that felt grateful after his exertions. A shaft
of brilliant sunshine, looking like a searchlight
where it penetrated the heavy mist, was reflected
and refracted to form a rainbow that shone
resplendently against the dark wall of the canyon.
On each side rose a sheer wall of rock, with
here and there a small fir or spruce clinging to
fissures where sufficient earth had accumulated
to give it nourishment. At the point where the
cataract struck the pool there was a mass of
heaving, foaming water that spread in ever
lessening waves to become gentle ripples lapping
softly on the shores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little birds known as waterousels, or
dippers, were in their element. Standing on
the rocks around which the turbulent waters
roared, they bobbed and curtsied, then flew in
under the waterfall to their nests in the damp
niches of the rocks. Far overhead, like a speck
in the azure sky, a bald eagle careened and
soared. Over all was the thunder of the cataract
drumming in Donald’s ears and giving to
the earth a gentle tremor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began eagerly to joint his rod, attach
leader and flies, and unfold his landing-net.
“There,” he said, when he had completed the
task, “I’ll just throw that in to soak while I
have a smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He cast carelessly, laid the rod down and
reached for a cigarette. “B-r-r-r-r,” the reel
shrilled madly. He made a wild clutch for the
rod, retrieving it just as the tip entered the water.
A big rainbow trout leaped into the air with a
flash of prismatic colours, and made that graceful
curve that is so pleasing to the fisherman’s eye.
The five-ounce rod bent double as he checked
the trout’s rush. Then the line slackened as the
fish turned and came toward him with incredible
speed. He reeled frantically to take in the
slack line. Once more the gamey trout turned
and the line was singing with the strain. Suddenly
it went straight down and in the pellucid
depths he could see it lying near the bottom with
tail and fins moving listlessly. Slowly he reeled
in the line, bringing the fish nearer and nearer.
With landing-net extended Donald leaned forward;
but with a quick flirt of its tail the trout
shot to the surface, sending a shower of spray in
his face. Then, leaping and dashing—the reel
singing merrily—it crossed the pool with renewed
energy. Unexpectedly the whirr of the reel
ceased and the rod was nearly jerked from
Donald’s hands—a detested “back lash.” In
other words, the line had tangled at the reel.
The slender rod was bent nearly to a circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t stand it,” muttered Donald in a
fever of excitement. He lowered the tip slowly
to relieve the strain on the rod, all the while
working desperately to free the tangle. Snap!
The fish with a tremendous tug parted the
leader, and with one last triumphant leap to
flaunt its brilliant colours, it disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is universally understood among the angling
fraternity that when a fish is lost under such
conditions the Recording Angel turns her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an hour the cold spray from the glacial
water had dampened Donald’s clothing and
benumbed his fingers. The basket by then
being nearly full, and his wrist lame from casting
and playing the fish, he decided to quit. As he
climbed the ridge the air above felt like a breath
from an oven in contrast to the atmosphere of
the canyon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through a tall, stately grove of pines Donald
descried an open glade whence came the sound
of running water. He walked through the dark
aisles of towering trees, his feet making no sound
on the thick carpet of soft needles. Pushed aside
a growth of low deciduous trees that fringed
this open passage in the woods, he gazed upon
a scene that held him entranced. At some time
in the earth’s remote history moving ice had
gouged out this tiny valley and left a rich deposit
of glacial silt. A small mountain stream cascaded
from a moss-covered cliff to fall from ledge to
ledge and flash crystal clear and sparkling through
the vividly green grass and bright flowers which
formed the carpet of the valley floor. The
brilliant columbine, interspersed with the yellow
marigold and dandelion, made bright splotches
of colour. Wild roses hung in masses in the
border of low green shrubs. The white rein
orchis grew in rank profusion everywhere, filling
the air with its delicate perfume. Ferns and
cotton grass grew to the very edge of the limpid
brook that prattled musically over the moss-covered
stones. A rabbit with her young nibbled
at the tender grass roots at the far side of the
creek. Humming-birds buzzed back and forth
and a bluejay—the Paul Pry of the woods—peered
curiously down at the interloper, with
its head moving from side to side and its beady
eyes shining. Then with a startled shriek it
flew across the glade—like a streak of blue in the
sunshine—to hold excited colloquy with its
mate. A willow grouse sailed from a cliff above
to land with a great preening of feathers and move
with a peculiar gliding run to the shelter of a
stand of salal bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the centre of the field was a “fairy ring”
of mushrooms about twelve feet across. The
beginning of these rings may be a single mushroom
which drops its spores in a circle about its
base. The next season a smaller ring of mushrooms
drops a larger ring of spores, and so the
circle expands year by year, exactly as the ripple
spread out on the surface of a pond when a stone
is cast into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some fairy rings have been estimated to be six
hundred years old. Legend informs us that
these rings are magic circles within which elves
and other nimble fairy folk hold their revels at
midnight. There is another superstition that
the rings mark the spots where bolts of lightning
have struck the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fairy-land!” breathed Donald as he stepped
into the open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was warm, but now and again a breeze, that
had swept between snow-capped peaks, dropped
down into the valley and made the pines sway
and the willow and alder leaves coolly rustle.
At the time of these visitations Donald threw back
his head and drew in deep breaths of the flower-scented
breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Making his way to the foot of the tiny falls,
Donald seated himself on a soft bed of moss and
proceeded to eat his lunch. Two birds, of the
species known as “camp-robbers” or “whiskey-jacks,”
dropped ghost-like from nowhere and
eyed him reproachfully. He threw them a crust
of bread. There was a shrill cry like that of a
hawk, that sent the feathered visitors in terror
to the safety of the trees, and a flash of blue
landed on the bread. With a chuckle, almost
human a bluejay flew to the top of a spruce to
enjoy his meal at leisure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s happy laugh rang throughout the
sylvan glade and was re-echoed mockingly from
the cliffs. The camp-robbers emerged from
their retreat looking rather crestfallen. They
took no chances with the crust thrown to them
the second time. Each seized a generous portion
and retreated hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald selected a soft spot in the shade of a
small grove of cedars, stretched himself at full
length on his back, and lighted a cigarette. The
sound of murmuring waters, the rustle of leaves,
the gentle sighing of the pines, and the fragrant,
balmy air that fanned his face held a soporific
influence. He watched a fleecy cloud floating
far above the tree-tops in the ethereal blue. A
long-tailed wren, of the white throat and white
eye lines sang joyously from a tree nearby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s eyes closed slowly, and in a moment
he was in a doze. As though in a dream he felt
something brush his face and he shook his head.
An instant later the tip of a cedar bough fell
fairly on his face. He brushed quickly with his
hand as though to dislodge a fly. A larger branch
fell with a gentle swish to land on his nose. This
time he opened his eyes and plucked the branch
from his face, noticing as he did so that it was
freshly broken. “Odd,” he thought, and lay
with eyes half closed to detect the cause of this
singular occurrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the top of the four small cedars under
which he lay there seemed to be a nest-like
thickness. There was a movement in the tops of
the trees, and Donald’s amazed eyes saw a little
brown hand steal forth holding a cedar tip.
Then a small childish face appeared, surrounded
by a mass of lovely golden hair. The face was
one of sheer, exquisite blonde beauty, marked
by a pair of wide, roguish blue eyes, as blue
as pansies, a small pensive mouth that formed
a cupid’s bow, and an impudent little nose dotted
with freckles. As the slender hand loosed the
branch, Donald’s astonished eyes looked up
directly into the blue ones looking down on him
so full of mischief. There was a startled gasp
and the golden head disappeared amid a great
swaying of branches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald came slowly to his feet, rubbing his
eyes. Was this a fantastic dream, or had he
actually seen a child’s face? He looked at the
branches on the ground, and again his eyes
sought the tree-tops. He could now see that
some sort of big nest was built within the tops of
the four small cedars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello,” he ventured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slight rustling of the branches followed, but
no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, wood-nymph!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still no answer, but a low silvery laugh was proof
that the occupant of the nest was not a wraith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you are a fairy,” he persisted, “won’t
you come down and give me a Terpsichorean
exhibition in the fairy ring on the floor of your
enchanted glade?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a dryad,” came the dulcet tone of a
childish voice, “and a dryad’s life is bound up in
her tree. I cannot leave my arboreal bower
until the hour of midnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about that,” laughed Donald as he
seized the slender cedars and rocked them violently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A scream of simulated fear came from the tree-tops.
“Stop!” the voice cried, “I’ll come down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tiny moccasined foot felt its way to a limb,
and a slight figure clad in men’s overalls and a
brown cotton shirt, stood erect with downcast eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jump,” invited Donald, as he stood with
arms outstretched; “fairies don’t weigh much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “dryad” shook her head bashfully, then
with a quick, bird-like motion sprang straight out
into the air, her golden hair streaming and flashing
in the sunshine. She landed gracefully on her
moccasined feet and went bounding across the
valley, leaping the creek with the ease and grace
of an antelope, and, without turning her head,
disappeared in the dark forest aisles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s black eyes remained fixed on the spot
where the fairy-like vision vanished from view.
His whole attitude registered astonishment. He
was completely mystified by the appearance of a
girl in this remote wilderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He climbed the trees for a glimpse of the
golden-haired fairy’s bower. A rope was tied
around the tops of the four cedars, with interlacings
of cord between. This rope pocket was
filled with pine boughs, and these covered with
ferns and moss. A cord that led to a nearby
spruce was, he decided, used to impart a swinging
motion to this strange maiden’s cosy retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the centre of this cosy nest lay a copy of
“Tennyson’s Poems” and a book on “Bird
Life.” As Donald leaned closer a gentle breeze
fluttered the leaves of the book of poems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fairy hands turned to the right page,” he
mused aloud as he read these lines from “Maud.”</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“A corner of dreamland,” murmured Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stronger breeze swept down the valley,
causing the nest to rock with gentle undulations.
“A novel idea,” he thought, “and what a restful
spot to sleep and dream!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald was tempted to finish his nap in the
vacated dryad’s nest, but put the thought aside
as being almost a sacrilege. He descended to the
ground, picked up his basket and started down
the mountain. As he neared the lake he saw the
trapper with Douglas and Andy sitting outside
the cabin door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any luck, ol’ timer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald lifted the lid of the basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” ejaculated the trapper. “Them’s
wallopers, ain’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John,” queried Donald as he sat down on the
grass, “did you ever see a dryad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dryad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trapper’s wrinkled face puckered. “Yeh,”
he answered quizzically, “I seen lots of them
fellers in Vancouver one time after I’d bin drinkin’
for a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald told of his meeting with the strange child
of the forest. “Who is she, John?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was little Connie Wainwright. She an’
her father live in a little valley t’other side of
that bluff,” pointing up the mountain. “She’s
a great kid, too. She has a hoss that’s named
after a hoss that had wings. I forgit the name she
calls him.” The trapper pondered for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pegasus,” prompted Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it. She rides that hoss like a Texas
Ranger, an’ she’s a crack shot with the rifle.
Funny thing, though, she ain’t ever shot anything
to my knowledge ’cept a cougar that tried
to get her pet deer. Her father’s jest the same,
he won’t kill nothin’ an’ they’ve got all the birds
’round their cabin as tame as chickens. They
are always studyin’ birds, flowers, an’ animals.
He’s an Englishman of eddication, an’ he’s
eddicated the kid, too. Was the ‘Breed’ with
her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Who is the Breed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a half-breed Indian with a lame leg.
He came over the trail ’bout two years ago. Got
one look at that shiny haired kid an’ thought she
was an angel, I guess, an’ has been hantin’ her
ever since. He built hisself a cabin up there.
Works for Wainwright in the summer an’ traps
in the winter. He follers that kid ’round like a
dog follers its master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald was interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must call on them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be glad to see ye, as ye can talk his
lingo. His langwidge is too high-falutin’ for me.
He sometimes comes to ask me ’bout the habits
of animals, but I got a sneakin’ notion that he
knows more ’bout it than I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening Donald and Andy visited the
recluse.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>The</span> trail to Wainwright’s cabin was a mere
path that followed the vagaries of a small mountain
stream which at times flowed with a tranquil
murmur, then suddenly plunged over ledges and
shattered itself into creamy foam on the worn
rocks below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of breath from the steep climb, Donald
and Andy sat down as they reached the bluff.
Everywhere was the song of birds and the
whispering of gentle zephyrs laden with the
fragrance of the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whit, whit, whit, ch’ wee-e-e-e,” sounded
the shrill hunting call of an osprey, or “fish-hawk,”
as he wheeled over the lake, then made
his spectacular plunge and rose on high with a
fish gripped in his long, powerful talons. Donald
watched him carry it to his mate, who was
standing guard over a big nest in the top of a
dead pine. Again the male bird dropped like
a bolt, struck the water with a loud splash, and
disappeared below the surface for a few seconds,
then rose to scatter spray in his struggles to lift
himself clear of the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bald eagle, from the vantage point of a tall
fir, took instant note of the successful fisherman,
and with a majestic swoop flew under the smaller
bird. Higher and higher rose the osprey, the eagle
relentlessly pursuing, until at last the intimidated
bird released its hold on the prize. With a scream
of triumph the eagle seized the glistening, wriggling
fish in mid-air and bore it away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the woods in their rear came the lilt of
a song mingled with the thud of flying hoofs,
and around a tangle of low spruce came a piebald
cayuse at full gallop. On his bare back the
girl of the woods was standing with arms outstretched,
pirouetting on her moccasined toes like
a dancing dervish. Her heavy hair streaming
about her face and shoulders, she seemed even
more an elf than when poised for flight on the
edge of her fairy nest. As she neared the bluff
she settled to her seat and seized the reins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald came to his feet. For a moment it
seemed as if he were to be passed unnoticed.
He ran to the trail and waved his arm with a
welcoming shout. This brought him a flash of
startled blue eyes, then the cayuse with a snort
of fear went straight up into the air, spinning
high on his hindlegs. A sharp word of command
and a quick twist of the nut-brown hands
caused the frightened beast to half turn and
lower his forelegs gently to the ground. As he
stepped to the cayuse’s head Donald noted the
lean and sinewed flanks of the animal, the strong
muscled shoulders, and the slender but powerful
limbs. He stroked the shiny neck and Pegasus
made answer to such advances by rubbing his
moist nose against Donald’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing mythical about this steed,” observed
Donald, gently prodding the bunched muscles on
the horse’s chest. “And,” he added jestingly,
“I do not see the golden bridle presented by the
goddess to Bellerophon while he slept.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A subtle flicker danced momentarily in the
corners of the blue orbs of the rider. “I have
clipped his wings, so I have no need of the
magic bridle,” she said smilingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice was gentle and mellow. The pronunciation,
clear and perfect, held a trace of English
accent that was pleasing to Donald’s ears. One
could not look upon Connie without thinking of
flowers, birds and sunshine. Constant exercise had
turned her muscles into cords of steel; mountain
air and sunshine had darkened her face and hands
to a deep bronze and brought to her cheeks a warm
glow that showed richly through the coat of tan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie looked on this stranger as a being
infinitely beyond her ken, a part of a world of
which she had no knowledge. His tall, well-knit
body, his shining black hair, dark flashing
eyes, his fine clothes and his deep resonant voice
were a source of wonder and admiration to this
girl, whose knowledge of men was limited to a
few lone trappers and Indians. She was suddenly
disconcerted and felt like running away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was on my way to call on you. Is your
father home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surprised at her own boldness, Connie slipped
lightly to the ground and stood beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she rejoined awkwardly, “he is. I’ll
go with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald spoke again, with a playful smile that
caused the girl to flush with a mixture of pleasure
and confusion. “I thought when I saw you
poised on Pegasus’s back that a close inspection
would disclose a pair of transparent, gauzy wings,
but,” peering at her shoulders, “evidently the
rider is clipped as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they walked up the path, Andy following,
it seemed to Connie that they were strolling
through the fields of Elysium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first glance Donald saw that Wainwright’s
log cabins had been built by a rank novice. The
walls were rakishly askew, the corners out of
plumb, and the joints showed big gaps filled
with moss. The rough construction of the
dissimilar, rambling cluster of houses served to
enhance rather than mar the wild grandeur of
this oasis on the rocky mountain-side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into this valley poured a mountain stream
which had gouged out for itself a canyon, through
which its waters swept and tumbled, as green
as jade in the sunlight, like emerald in the
shadow, and snowy white in the roaring rapids.
On the other side, the towering profiles of the
cliffs were edged with stunted growths of pine and
spruce, while here and there were soft patches
of green moss clinging to the damp places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The few acres wrested from the wilderness
were rich with a green carpet of clover and
timothy, and in a pasture at the corner a sleek
Jersey cow was feeding diligently. In the same
enclosure a deer nibbled delicately at the tender
shoots. A flock of pure white ducks, in single
file, waddled down the hill and plunged with a
subdued quacking into a small pond. Within
a yard enclosed by a fence of split cedar the
lusty crow of a rooster sounded above the cackling
of his family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The low walls of the main cabin were festooned
with a mass of wild creepers in which the
wild honeysuckle predominated. Wild flowers,
each species separate, were growing in neat
round plots bordered with carefully arranged
stones. Scores of birds flitted through the low
bushes, rested on fences and roofs, or hopped
unafraid through the grass. Siskins and finches
there were, in gold or olive; blue jays and their
cousins, the camp-robbers; bluebirds; sparrows
singing sweetly; waxwings “zeeping” through
the garden; warblers gurgling softly; scolding
grey flycatchers and numerous other species
unknown to Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A camp-robber flew to Connie’s outstretched
arm. From the capacious pocket of her overalls
she brought a crust of bread, at which the bird
pecked hungrily. Another bird lighted on the
brim of Andy’s wide hat. The little man attempted
to peer up at it without moving his
head, and the effort set his bushy eyebrows
dancing. “Get off there, you blighter!” he
growled. “I don’t want any bloomin’ trimmin’s
on me ’ead gear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time Andy had spoken. Connie
turned to him, her eyes wide with curiosity.
His droll face, the strange dialect and the lively
eyebrows caused a flock of dimples to chase each
other about her pretty lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s father and the Breed, working in the
vegetable garden below, glanced up and, seeing
the strangers, laid down their tools and came up
the hill, the Breed moving jerkily on his crippled
limb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raleigh Wainwright was a man of rather
striking appearance. He was slender, grey-haired,
clean chiselled, and carried himself with
a military bearing. There was a certain fineness
in the slight figure, a symmetry of design, that
suggested that indefinable something which is
the hall-mark of good breeding. He had a way
of carrying his well-shaped head that accentuated
this aristocratic air. His grey eyes met
Donald’s with a level gaze as they shook hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a cursory glance, Joe Pardon, the Breed,
settled himself on a seat against the wall of the
cabin and rolled a cigarette. His face was
swarthy and sombre; coarse black hair topped
his head. In repose his features wore the
impassive expression of the Indian, but when he
smiled—which rarely happened—he showed the
French strain in his blood and became almost
handsome. He was of a sturdier build than the
average Siwash Indian, and as he leaned against
the logs, with muscular arms folded across his
powerful chest, one would have thought him
the embodiment of all that is strong and virile
in man, until the eyes rested on the pitifully malformed
leg, shrunken to one-half its normal size.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you come inside?” asked Wainwright
politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” answered Donald, “but if you
don’t mind I’d rather look at your flower garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was quite evident that their host was
pleased by this statement. “You are interested
in flowers?” he questioned eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am,” admitted Donald, “but unfortunately
I don’t know much about them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dignified Englishman proved to be not
only an intelligent, but a most willing teacher.
From plot to plot they went, the botanist glad
to talk on his hobby to an attentive audience.
He gave the names of the plants, their mode of
germination, growth, nature and uses. For
half-an-hour his quiet voice went on until the
lengthening shadows deepened. As they moved
toward the cabin, the Breed passed them carrying
a pail brimming with milk, at which Andy gazed
with longing eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We always have a light lunch in the evening;
won’t you stay?” begged their host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy nodded his blond head vigorously in a
silent signal to Donald for acceptance, and
acceptance was instantly forthcoming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interior of the log cabin was rough in the
extreme, but scrupulously clean, with chairs,
tables and beds that had never issued from a
furniture factory. The window-curtains were
made of flour and sugar sacks, on which the
names of the manufacturers could still be
deciphered. On one wall were two bunks,
set one above the other, on which were spread
heavy Hudson Bay blankets. No sheets were
in evidence, and the pillows were rough sacks
stuffed with moss. The lower bunk showed
the feminine touch in its drapery of cheap
blue print, a pathetic attempt to brighten the
coarse surroundings. Behind a small stove
in the corner hung an array of cooking utensils,
spotlessly clean, but of inferior quality. The one
and only table, placed conveniently near the
stove, was as white as a ship’s deck from constant
scouring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In direct antithesis to this seeming poverty,
one end of the cabin was literally filled with
books. These richly-bound volumes looked incongruous
in conjunction with the rough tables,
the uncomfortable chairs and the rude beds.
Donald’s eyes roved over the books, arranged
on the shelves standing and crosswise. Most of
them were in English, but many were in German,
French and Italian; some in what appeared to
be Arabic, perhaps Sanskrit; and dozens were
on botany, ornithology and natural history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bookworm,” mused Donald, “a bookworm,
and at the expense of his personal comfort.”
He felt ashamed of his unwarranted
criticism of their kind host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I built this cabin all alone,” informed
Wainwright proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s eyes rested on the speaker. Wainwright
wore a shooting-jacket and riding-breeches
of excellent cut and of rare material,
but now worn threadbare and neatly patched.
Donald knew that those rents had been mended
by a woman’s hands. Wainwright’s æsthetic
face was impressive. The marks of toil could
not hide the delicacy of his thin hands with their
long, tapering fingers. The hands of a dreamer
or poet, thought Donald, not the hands to wield
an axe. A quick admiration for this man’s gameness
filled his heart. “A good job,” he lied, as
he surveyed the sagging roof and bulging walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As good an authority as Hillier told me that
it was excellent work,” stated their host rather
boastfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless old John’s heart!” thought Donald
fervently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was plain that Connie had anticipated their
staying for lunch, as the table was set—with
tin plates and cups—for four. She drew a pan
of hot rolls from the tiny oven, and, her face a
deep red from the heat and her exertions, she
sat down to the table, using a canned goods box
as a seat. Donald noticed that the two chairs
had been given up to the guests, and he arose
at once to offer his seat. Andy, not to be outdone
in gallantry, successfully prevailed on
Connie to make the change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bit shorter ever day,” he grinned as he sank
to the box. At this Connie lowered her head,
her shoulders shaking with merriment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright’s manner was that of the owner
of a baronial estate entertaining guests under the
most luxurious surroundings. His cheeks were
flushed, and he seemed filled with a boyish
happiness. “It no doubt will seem incomprehensible
to you,” he remarked with a smile,
“when I say that, with the exception of John
Hillier, you are the first white men to break
bread with me under this roof. We are quite a
distance from the Pemberton trail, and therefore
come in contact with but few travellers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little wonder, Donald thought, at their host’s
nervous gaiety and the child’s distress. What
turn of Fate had caused this scholar to seek a
home in so lonely a spot? Misanthropes fled
to the wilderness to escape their fellow-men,
but their welcome was proof that Wainwright
was not of that class. Why, then, had he
voluntarily become an anchorite? Was he
obsessed by his hobby to such an extent that he
had ostracized himself to carry on the study of
Nature? Was he a criminal hiding from justice?
Donald put the latter thought aside quickly.
The Englishman’s delicate features, with wide
forehead, clear eyes, and tender, sensitive mouth,
were not the features of a man of criminal
tendencies. At times, when in repose, Wainwright’s
face held a deep and brooding sadness.
Some tragedy had entered his life, Donald
decided; some great calamity, that had seared
his very soul, had driven him to the life of a
recluse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie strove to appear at ease, but without
success. Hoping to relieve her embarrassment,
Donald spoke to her. Although she ventured
an upward glance, his voice seemed only to
heighten her confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wainwright resumed the discussion of
the wild flowers of British Columbia. With his
head held sidewise, Andy listened intently
to the flow of conversation. When their host
used Latin words Andy’s face would assume
a bewildered expression. With eyebrows raised
inquiringly and a humorous smile playing about
his lips, he would turn to Connie and slowly
shake his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This odd little man, with his blithesome
manner and the whimsical gleam in his blue
eyes, was extremely amusing to Connie, and it
was with difficulty that she controlled her mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I s’y,” observed Andy deferentially, “I’d
like to learn about these flowers and things;
but, strike me ’andsome, the big words you use,
and some of them in the bohunk langwidge,
puts more’n ’arf of it over me bloomin’ ’ead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright’s laugh had a pleasant ring.
“I’ll do my best to help you, Mr. Pettray.
You’ll find books here,” pointing to the shelves,
“that will be of greater assistance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The keen mountain air made itself felt
through the poorly chinked walls of the cabin,
and the company moved their chairs nearer to
the warmth of the crackling fire. Donald
offered their host a cigar, which was accepted and
smoked with evident relish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Start me at the beginnin’; put me in the
kindergarten, where my size belongs,” chuckled
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright leaned back in the rough chair,
puffing luxuriously at his cigar, sending wreaths
of fragrant smoke about his head. “I hardly
know where to begin,” he said meditatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room suddenly grew dark, and they
heard the soft sighing of the wind in the branches
of the trees nearby. These signs were precursors
of one of the mountain showers so common in the
coast Range of the Province. A moment later
there came the intermittent patter of big raindrops
on the roof, gradually increasing until it became
a strumming roar that debarred conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie lighted a candle, and using the neck
of an empty vinegar bottle as a candlestick, she
placed it on the table, then took a seat outside
the radius of the dim light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened to admit the Breed. As he
entered a rush of sweet rain-washed air, laden
with the odour of fragrant buds, filled the room.
Shaking a shower of glistening raindrops from
his wide sombrero, the Breed hobbled silently on
moccasined feet to a seat in the corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pelting rain dwindled to a drizzle, then
stopped as abruptly as it had begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an hour Wainwright gave a disquisition
of the value of plant life to mankind. Selecting
two books from the shelves, he placed them on
the table before Andy. “You will find no
difficulty in understanding these volumes, as
they are written for the novice. You will also
find that there is no pursuit more conducive
to health and happiness than the study of plants.
It keeps one largely in the open air, and promotes
pure and helpful thinking. For this reason
parents should lead the minds of their children
to the study of plant life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During her father’s discourse Connie’s eyes
scarcely left Donald’s face. The Breed from the
darkness of the corner noticed her rapt interest
in the tall stranger, and his dusky eyes glittered
with jealousy. He limped to the doorway,
and, as he turned, Donald could not repress a
start as he caught the malignant look of hate
which shot from the half-breed’s glowing eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Constance, dear, will you play for us?”
asked her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved obediently to her bunk, and from
the floor beneath she drew out a much worn
violin case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mellow radiance from the candle and the
ever-changing lights from the open draft of the
small stove cast long, wavering shadows within
the cabin. From without came the wailing of
the wind, the creaking of the trees, and the
steady drip of water from the eaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the bow touched the strings Connie forgot
her shyness. The violin drifted into a melody
as light as a bird singing through the trees,
now joyous, anon sobbing in a deep rhythm of
eerie sadness. As she played her body swayed,
almost imperceptibly, as a blossoming tree
sways under a soft spring breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the last note ascended and faded on the
throbbing air, Connie’s embarrassment returned.
At Donald’s words of praise a scarlet flush dyed
her cheeks. She returned the instrument to its
case, and, with eyes downcast, resumed her seat
in the darkened corner. Wainwright’s eyes held
a look of deep tenderness as he thanked her in a
voice that was like a caress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they said good-night Donald saw that their
host’s face was again shrouded in deep melancholy.
The light of a waning moon threw ghost-like
shadows as they stumbled down the narrow
trail through the aromatic woods. Save for
the drip of water, a brooding hush hung over the
forest. The trail was soft with needles, on which
their feet made only a softened beating. In
the nave of huge conifers the solemnity of the
forest made speech seem almost irreverent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the centre of the tunnel-like trail, where
the shadows deepened, Donald stopped short
with every sense alert. Without knowing why,
he suddenly felt a quick sense of danger. A
dark form rose in front of them and slunk into
the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The blinkin’ Indian,” whispered Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In passing the spot where the Breed had disappeared,
Donald had an uncanny feeling that
the burning eyes of Connie’s devoted guardian
were fixed on him and he felt a crinkly chill
creep up his spine. It was with a feeling of
relief that they emerged from the obscurity of
the timber and caught the friendly gleam of
light from their cabin window on the lake-shore
far below.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>The</span> following day their work brought Donald
and his companions to the top of the falls near
Connie’s fairy nest. The melting snows from
above had swelled the water until it filled the
narrow gorge to the brim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Donald viewed the thundering river he
was impressed by the potential power in the
mighty surge of water that flung itself in a
cascade of foam to the rocks below. “Good
place for a dam!” he shouted to Gillis, as he
pointed to the narrow canyon and then to the
slanting walls that formed a natural basin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, while Andy pursued his studies
on flowers, Donald covered several sheets of
notepaper with drawings and figures. He became
so deeply engrossed in his work that he
sat up long after the others had gone to bed.
At breakfast he placed the result of his night’s
work near Gillis’s plate. “Jack, I believe we
could put in an electric mill that would be
successful,” he said earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis studied the papers carefully, then passed
them to Douglas. “Might be done,” he said
non-committally. “I don’t know nothin’ ’bout
electricity; do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had a little experience,” admitted
Donald modestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas, who had been poring over the
drawings, spoke emphatically. “I’ll bet Dad
would be interested in this. I’ve heard him say
that all mills would be electrically driven sometime.
He’s up-to-date—always willing to listen
to new ideas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But old ‘Moss-back’ ain’t,” growled Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s old ‘Moss-back’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the office men by name of Renwick.
He’s one of them narrow-’tween-the-eyes, psalm-singin’
old has-beens that sez ‘tut tut’ every
time he hears a logger say ‘damn.’ His health
is poor, so they’re goin’ to send him up here to
take charge of this mill. Thanks be, I’m goin’
to have charge in the woods, so I won’t have
nothin’ to do with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They discussed the matter during the day, and
that evening they again visited the falls. From the
trapper Donald learned that the supply of water
was unfailing. Owing to the natural formation, the
cost of building the dam would be small. Donald’s
friends became as enthusiastic as himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be finished to-morrow night, Douglas,”
announced Gillis that evening. “If you and
Donald want to, you can go to town and put
this proposition up to your father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lines of steel were creeping north slowly
but surely. As they left the cabin to start for
the Coast, the first faint boom of a blast was
brought to their ears by the southern breeze.
Ten miles south of the lake they came to steel
and rode to Squamish in the cab of a locomotive,
reaching Vancouver that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas informed Donald over the ’phone
the next morning that his father would give him
a hearing at two o’clock that afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Donald thought of the impending meeting
he experienced certain inward qualms. He felt
that Renwick would oppose him, and wondered
if Robert Rennie would consider him conceited
and forward in suggesting such a radical innovation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the appointed hour Donald and Douglas
entered the office of the R. C. &amp; L. Co. Robert
Rennie greeted Donald with a friendly smile and
motioned to chairs near the desk. “You have
some papers with you, I presume,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald placed the rough plans on the desk
before him. For five minutes Robert Rennie
studied them quietly while Donald fidgeted.
Without comment, he leaned back in his chair
for a moment, apparently in deep thought.
Presently he pressed a button at the side of his
desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send Renwick, Bolton and King here,” he
said to the boy who answered the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the men entered the room Donald had no
difficulty in recognizing Renwick from Gillis’s
description. Robert Rennie rose to introduce
Donald, then spoke in quick, flashing sentences,
that went straight to the heart of things, as he
spread the plans on the table before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Donald had anticipated, Renwick, after a
short scrutiny of the papers, objected strenuously,
his chief objection being the initial cost,
together with the fact that experience had
demonstrated that only small mills had proved
a success when electrically driven. Bolton was
of the same opinion, but he admitted that if the
supply of timber were sufficient to keep the mill
in operation for years, the initial cost would be
offset by the economy of operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>King, the company’s chief engineer, vouchsafed
no opinion, but sat with Donald’s plans
before him, copying the figures in his note-book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Rennie glanced at Donald expectantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald spoke of the lessened cost of operation
in an electrically-driven mill by the reduction of
the number of millwrights, oilers and helpers,
the lower insurance rates, the saving on line-shafting,
belts and oil, of the advantage in speed
over a steam-mill, etc. As he warmed to the subject
he came to his feet and leaned over the desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you gentlemen know, the greatest enemy
of the mill-owner is fire. With a steam-mill of
the size you are to build, with donkey engines
and locomotives operated by steam, you will
have a battery of smokestacks that will be an
hourly menace during the summer months in
the dry air at that altitude. Electrify your mill
and donkey engines and you will reduce the
fire hazard by seventy-five per cent. I don’t
ask you to accept my opinion. I advise you
to investigate thoroughly before deciding. An
electric mill with the enormous power available
would be a credit, not only to this company, but
to the Province as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Rennie’s brain functioned with a clear-cut
precision. He would listen to the advice of
his experts with an attentive ear, and his decision
was usually made before the last one had ceased
talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Donald was talking Robert Rennie sat
forward in his chair with a look of almost strained
attention. As Donald finished he swung quickly
to his chief engineer. “King, to-morrow you
go to Summit Lake. Furnish a full report. If
your figures correspond with McLean’s we will
install an electric plant. Bolton, get quotations
at once on electrical equipment. That’s all,” he
finished tersely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to the two young men as the door
closed. “Beginning with the first of next month,
McLean, if you so wish, you will act as assistant
manager at the Summit Lake Mill. And you,”
he turned to Douglas, “will occupy a similar
position at the Cheakamus plant.” He rang for
his stenographer, who entered at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald muttered an embarrassed thanks, and
as he passed through the door he heard Robert
Rennie’s voice in rapid dictation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They spent the remainder of the afternoon
buying supplies from the list which Andy had
furnished them. There were numerous delicacies
in the items of foodstuffs that brought
exclamations of surprise from Douglas. “There
is everything here to serve a banquet; even
tablecloths and napkins. What is the little beggar
up to now, I wonder?” he said laughingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His birthday,” explained Donald. “He is
going to invite the Wainwrights and John Hillier.
And besides,” he added, “I think he wants to
show the old trapper that he can do a little
fancy cooking himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet Rennie could not interpret the inner
urge that prompted her to arise at an early hour
the next morning to drive her brother to the
wharf. It rather bewildered her—made her
ashamed of herself that she could not put Donald
from her mind entirely. “Why can’t you forget
him?” she asked herself in protest for the
thousandth time. As the boat pulled away from
the dock she waved an adieu and, with a troubled
look in her eyes, swung her car cityward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For two days after their return to the mountains,
their little cabin was a hive of industry.
Andy banished his fellow-lodgers to the outdoors
at every opportunity while he performed
mysterious rites over the small stove. “I’ll
show that juggling old pirate what a real meal is
like,” he chuckled to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their guest arrived late in the afternoon and
sat outside in the warm sun while Andy busied
himself behind the closed door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old John’s face shone from the vigorous
application of soap and towel. His sole change
in attire for the occasion was a clean buckskin
coat from the breast pocket of which protruded
the corner of a red silk handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s abundant golden hair had been
carefully brushed, and hung over her shoulders
in glistening, billowy waves that reached to
her waist-line. She seated herself a short distance
from the party and took no part in the
conversation. This was her first social affair
and she felt ill at ease. Donald’s repeated
attempts to break her reserve were answered
in monosyllables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened to disclose a remarkable
figure framed in the entrance. Andy stood
before them in the most ridiculous make-up of
a butler. An old black coat of Gillis’s, cut off
at the sides to form a “claw-hammer,” hung
loosely over his narrow shoulders; side-whiskers
of tree moss were stuck to his cheeks, and his
face was as stolid as a graven image.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dinner is now being served in the main
dining-’all, me lord,” he intoned slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They applauded Andy’s effort heartily, and
as they laughingly entered the cabin a scene met
their eyes that was remarkably incongruous
amid such drab surroundings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A snow-white cloth covered the rough board
table. A huge turkey, with bulging breast
browned to a crispness, graced the centre of the
board. Oysters in the shell, celery, salads,
several kinds of vegetables, pies, cookies and
fancy cheeses were in tempting abundance; and
in a place of honour near the turkey reposed
Andy’s birthday cake, its frosted surface covered
with tiny candles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s blue eyes opened wide with wonder.
“Oh, Dad!” she cried joyously, “it’s just like
stories, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John tossed his hat to the floor in the corner.
“You can deliver the goods, ol’ timer, sure
enough,” he commended in a tone of respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an odd party that gathered in the log hut
in the wilderness to celebrate Andy’s birthday—a
wilderness whose silence was soon to be broken
by the crash of trees and the clang of steel. A
late blast, so near that the cabin trembled,
caused the old trapper to shiver slightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trains will soon be running through your
backyard, John,” observed Douglas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man shook his head sadly. “Yes,”
he concurred, “an’ I’ll hev’ to be hittin’ the trail
agin before long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s banquet proceeded merrily, and when
the last course was finished Donald took a
bundle from the shelf and placed it in Connie’s
hands. “Something I brought from town for
you,” he smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s colour heightened. “For me?” she
asked incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, some reading matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” she murmured softly, as her
quick fingers unwrapped the package. She cried
aloud with delight as half a dozen novels and as
many magazines were disclosed to view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And here, Andy, is a present for you,” said
Donald as he dragged a box from the corner;
“something to assist in passing away the time
pleasantly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s joy knew no bounds when, opening
the box, a superb Victrola was disclosed to
view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the sweet strains of a full orchestra
playing the “Barcarolle” filled the room. Connie
was enraptured. She stood with bowed
head and closed eyes, her hands pressed to her
throbbing breast, as the music stirred her
emotional soul to its depths. She sighed deeply
and her cheeks were wet with tears as she moved
to the machine when the music ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all sang the chorus to the “Old Oaken
Bucket,” “Suwannee River” and “Annie Laurie.”
Connie’s embarrassment had vanished and her
clear voice rang in sweet harmony with the
deeper tones of the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the conclusion of “Home Sweet Home,”
old John Hillier blew his nose vigorously and
surreptitiously dabbed the big red handkerchief
to his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words of “A Dream,” sung in an impassioned
tenor voice, came with surprising distinctness:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I dreamed thou wert living, my darling, my darling,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I dreamed that I pressed thee once more to my breast.</p>
<p class='line0'>Thy soft perfumed tresses and gentle caresses</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Thrilled me and stilled me and lulled me to rest.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Donald saw that Wainwright was deeply
moved. His throat was working convulsively, and
he seemed to have difficulty in lighting his pipe.
His shaking hands were cupped over his pipe-bowl
in an attempt to hide his emotion. His face
was pale and tears brimmed his clear grey eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, John, let’s ’it up a jig!” cried Andy
as he capered across the room and pulled the
trapper to his feet. To the lilt of the “Irish
Washerwoman” the odd pair smacked the floor
with their feet, whirled in giddy circles, and
whooped like wild men. They linked arms
and spun like a top until John’s moccasined foot
trod on Andy’s long coat and brought them to
the floor in a heap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The comedy helped Wainwright to regain his
composure, and sent Connie into screams of
happy laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had a most wonderful evening, Andy,”
said Connie gratefully as they were leaving.
“The most wonderful in my life,” she added
softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, Mr. Pettray,” spoke Mr.
Wainwright from the doorway, “how are you
progressing with your studies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not ’arf bad,” answered Andy. “I ’ave
learned about the sepals, calyx, corolla, pistil,
filament, anther, pollen, style and stigma.”
As he rattled off these words he glanced at
Gillis and Douglas. He had been longing for
this chance to air his newly-acquired knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine,” complimented Wainwright smilingly.
“You are having no difficulty, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy wrinkled his brows. “I ’ave found it a
bit difficult,” he began importantly; “just a
bit, you know, to classify the flowers as to whether
they are oxillary, confulate, peduncular, polyandrous,
gynandrous, zygomorphic——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy mackerel!” roared Gillis, as he clapped
his hands over his ears. “Stop him, somebody!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas caught Andy by the coat-tail and
dragged him from the door. Connie’s cheerful
laughter drifted back to them through the
darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Breed crossed the outer edge of light
thrown from the doorway and limped to the
trail. Wherever Connie went her argus-eyed
guardian flitted in the background.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>In</span> the construction of the railroad to
Summit Lake the speed and efficiency of the
R. C. &amp; L. Co’s organization excelled any past
effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The land-clearing outfit arrived the evening
after Andy’s party and began work on that
portion of the right-of-way that skirted the west
shore of the lake. Like a swath of destruction,
the ground became covered with the litter and
wreckage of blasted trees—noble trees that had
stood for centuries like silent sentinels guarding
the limpid blue lake lapping gently at their feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For two days Connie had been no nearer than
the bluff. Seated astride her horse, she now
gazed in startled awe on the invasion of her
loved valley. On the third day, drawn by a
horrible fascination, she ventured timidly into
the valley and watched with wide eyes the
advance of the pygmy army, who, with such
tiny tools as the axe and saw, crashed to earth
mammoth trees that seemed as enduring as the
mountains on which they stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The steam-shovel roared and crashed in the
distance as it ploughed deep gashes in the green
hillside, men shouted, heavy wagons banged
over the rough road, and fearful blasts shook the
air. Through all this tumult the men worked
in a frenzy of haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A giant fir—a veritable king of the forest,
towering in regal glory high above its mates—stood
near the water’s edge. Around the massive
bole of this tree Connie had played since her
earliest recollection. She had endowed this
half-god with a living personality, to whom she
had confided all her childish fancies and aspirations.
The corrugated bark bore numerous
bits of nursery rhymes, and her name was etched
deep with a sharp knife in several places. With
a lump in her throat she saw the “fallers”
move to the foot of this great tree and gaze aloft
with appraising eyes. Then sinewy arms sent
shining axes through the thick bark to form the
“scarf,” which to Connie appeared as a gaping
white wound on the dark grey trunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the cross-cut saw with its rasping clang
ate its way slowly through the tough fibre of
the great titan, Connie made inarticulate sounds
in her throat and for a moment covered her
eyes. As the wedge was applied, a great
shudder passed through the tree. Connie held
her breath. The tower of dark branches at the
top nodded as if in fond farewell. There
was a pause, then with a rending and tearing
crash it fell to earth with a thunder of sound that
filled the valley with a wild tumult of echoes.
A whistle blew shrilly, and the men picked up
their coats and walked toward their camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a short space Connie stood motionless.
Then, with a last long look at the fallen monarch,
she sighed deeply and turned to the trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night at dusk she came again. Donald
came upon her as she crouched, a forlorn figure,
by the prostrate tree. Pointing to her fallen
friend, whose top was torn and splintered, she
told Donald in halting sentences of the day’s
disaster. As he noted the grave face and trembling
lips, he wondered at the depth of feeling in one
so young. His soft words of sympathy brought
unseen tears to her eyes, and she dared not trust
her voice in answer. He spoke to her cheerily
on other subjects, but could not shake her
melancholy mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the night calm was ravaged by the
thunder of blasts. A lurid wall of flame shot
high in the air as a rocky portion of the shoreline
was rent asunder, and huge boulders
plunged into the calm lake, sending up pyramids
of water to break in noisy waves on the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald enjoyed the unusual experience of
witnessing the construction of a railroad, but
he understood now why the old trapper had
wagged his grey head sadly when he heard the
clamour of striving men and machinery creeping
up from the south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night work had ceased, and a welcome
silence settled over the shattered forest.
Lambent stars sparkled and twinkled in the high,
clear air, with colours that changed from orange
to blue and back again. The eastern sky
brightened, the glow gradually spread through
the heavens, then the moon came slowly over
the towering snow-peaks, flooding the valley
with light. The fallen tree took on a ghost-like
appearance in the moon’s radiance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then an uncanny thing happened. Suddenly
from a clear sky, without a moment’s
warning, a dark and ominous cloud obscured
the moon’s light. Connie came quickly to her
feet and gazed with startled eyes at this strange
phenomenon. The air took on a sudden chill.
A quick, strong wind swept up the hill. From
the swaying tree-tops there came a moaning
like a wailing requiem for the dead—so
much like the human voice that Donald
shivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Donald the darkening moon and the
sighing trees were a coincidence, but to this
child of nature, who had been reared in loneliness
where rivers roared and mountains loomed,
and who understood so intimately the wild
things of the forest, it was a manifestation of
sorrow by the God of Nature. With her
breast heaving tumultuously, she leaned against
the mammoth tree and pressed her cheek to its
rough bark. “I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” she
whispered brokenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if in answer to her words of compassion,
the veil suddenly lifted from the moon and the
wind ceased. Donald shook himself. “Rather
weird,” he said, with a quick, nervous laugh.
He turned to find that he was alone.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Events moved swiftly that week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>King’s report was favourable to Donald’s
plan, and word came that electrical equipment
for the Summit Mill had been ordered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Donald’s invitation Connie came to the
station to witness the arrival of the first train.
As the awesome black monster, with whistle
screaming and bell clanging, roared through the
rock cut at the south end of the lake and bore
down upon them, Connie gasped in wonder.
As the train came to a hissing stop she shrank
against the walls of the building, a startled look
in her eyes. She flushed at the men’s hearty
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train was loaded with working-men, who
with their bundles of blankets overflowed the
small platform. A kitchen-car and a sleeping-car
were shunted to the side-track which would
be their home until the erection of the big
dining-hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald was given charge of constructing the
dam, Gillis started the lumbering operations,
while Douglas moved to the Cheakamus Mill.
Andy was to be boss of the kitchen staff, and
was kept busy overseeing the work of interior
construction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A portable mill was fast at work turning out
timbers for the big plant, and carpenters and
millwrights worked night and day. An
American expert came with the machinery to
superintend the installation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the new task set for him there descended
on Donald a deep sense of responsibility.
Unlike the others, he worked no regular hours.
A feeling of gratitude toward Robert Rennie
for the confidence displayed in him kept him
at top speed; his energy and resource seemed
inexhaustible. From the time his alarm clock—that
harsh, brutal little destroyer of sleep—shrilled
its call at daylight until darkness filled
the valley, he stuck to his task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One week earlier than the time allotted he
reported the dam as finished.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Rennie came with Renwick and King
for a short trip of inspection, and as he was
leaving he spoke a kindly word in commendation
of Donald’s work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Summit Mill was to be modern in every
respect, lighted with electricity and provided
with modern plumbing and hot shower-baths.
The white steel beds of the dormitory were
clothed in clean white sheets and pillow-cases.
There was no analogy in this perfection to the
ordinary logging-camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For hours Donald followed the expert through
the mill, while the latter explained and tested
the different motors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once a week Robert Rennie came to the mill,
taking a keen interest in all phases of its construction,
and invariably he went away with a
pleased smile on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never saw the old man so worked up,”
commented Gillis. “Guess he’d like to come
up here and run her himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Renwick was still sceptical. For no apparent
reason he had taken a dislike to Donald. “It’s
just ’cause you and I are such good friends,”
explained Gillis. “Me and him get on like a
couple of strange bull-dogs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the huge three-storied mill, with its dry
kiln, lumber skids, conveyor shed and railroad
spurs, was ready for operation, and each machine
had been tested, Robert Rennie arrived with
other officials of the Company. Next morning
Donald’s heart thumped as the mill’s big whistle
sent out its first call to work and the men filed
eagerly to their posts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The logs were sprayed with huge water-jets as
they came up the chain-haul to clean them of
gravel and débris. The electric “nigger” spun
them about and threw them into place with a
thud that shook the mill. Then in a wild crescendo
of sound there rose the harsh chorus of
saws: the singing howl of the cut-off, the strident,
slurring sound of the gang-saws, and the staccato
snarl of the trimmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smiling and rubbing his hands, Robert Rennie
walked through the mill. “Running like a
greased pig,” shouted Gillis above the clamour.
The owner of the R. C. &amp; L. Co. so far forgot
his decorum as to slap the astonished Gillis
heartily on the back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald noticed an ever-increasing irritability
on the part of the logging foreman during the
next week. The ertswhile jocular Gillis became
sulky and morose. Donald got an inkling as to
the cause of his friend’s gloom when he heard
Gillis in conversation with Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the ’ell’s the matter, you big lunkus?
You’re like a bear with a sore foot,” complained
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If my gang don’t get here pretty soon, and
I have to put up with this crowd of bohunks
much longer, I won’t be fit to live with,” growled
Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis’s gang of “redshirts” were known the
length and breadth of British Columbia.
Employers bid high for their services, but for
many years they had stuck loyally with Gillis
and the R. C. &amp; L. Co. At present they were
employed by the Company in one of their camps
up the coast, but, at Gillis’s earnest request,
Robert Rennie had promised to send them to
Summit Lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis’s “redshirts” had the well-earned reputation
of being the wildest crew of lumber-jacks
west of the Rockies. “They’re wild, all right,”
Gillis had admitted; “a swearin’, drinkin’,
fightin’ gang of roughnecks. But holy mackerel!
How them boys can log!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Gillis confided his troubles to
Donald. “I don’t know what in tarnation’s to
become of loggin’ in years to come if things keep
on as they are now,” he began in a despondent
tone. “It used to be that when you sent down
town for loggers you got loggers. But now,”
with a gesture of disgust, “you git a lot of
silk-stockin’d, mandolin-playin’, gum-chewin’,
smooth-haired guys, or else a bunch of snuff-chewin’,
garlic-smellin’, macaroni-eatin’ bohunks,
whose names sound like a war in Central
Europe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sighing reminiscently, he continued: “I often
wonder if it’s because I’m gittin’ old; but, you
know, when I look back on the days, when
we logged with bull teams, it seems to me that
the men at that time <span class='it'>liked</span> to work. I can still
see the old timers in their whiskers, and their
big black hats and flannel shirts, as they sailed
out on the old <span class='it'>Comox</span> or the <span class='it'>Cassiar</span>.” He shook
his head sadly. “Ah! there was only one kind
of logger in them days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing that Donald was interested, he went
on: “Yes, there’s two kinds of loggers nowadays,
Donnie, the ‘single-breasted’ and the ‘double-breasted.’
And there’s a hell of a lot of difference
between the two. The ‘single-breasted’
logger is a man that don’t speak anythin’ but
English, an’ he don’t belong to the ‘I won’t
works’ neither. He knows loggin’ from A to
Z; don’t mind sleepin’ in a bunk, and always
carries his own blankets. If he borrows a ten-spot
off you, as soon as he earns it he comes
lookin’ for you, slips you the money, grabs you
by the hand, and lookin’ you straight in the eye,
says: ‘Thanks, friend, come and have a drink.’
At night, when he is through work, he’ll smoke
his pipe, grind his axe, talk about the next day’s
work with the boss, read the paper and go to
bed. In the mornin’ he’ll swallow a big load of
prunes and ham and eggs and go to work
a-singin’.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this ‘double-breaster’,” he snorted disgustedly,
“he’s a mixture of a taxi-driver, bartender
and soap-box orator, and just because he
lives in B.C., he thinks he is a logger. He
knows the difference between a fallin’ saw and
a bucket’s saw, and that just about lets him out.
If he borrows a dollar off you, the minute the
bill slips out of your hand you can see a look in
his eye that says, ‘You’re hooked.’ And the
devil of it is that he won’t cross to the other side
of the street when he sees you comin’, but he’ll
walk right up to you a-smilin’ and ask you for
another buck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When he gets through at night he cleans his
finger-nails and picks on a mandolin while he
tells how many Janes is stuck on him in Vancouver;
gives an opinion that the shower-bath
was not hot enough, and how we sufferin’
workers should rise against the capitalists. He’ll
kick at the breakfast table because there is only
oranges and no grape-fruit. When he goes in
the woods he’ll throw a few tools away so’s to
help the cause of the workers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Workers!” he exploded, as he came to his
feet and walked the floor, “we’ve got too many
‘double-breasteds’ and ‘hunks’ in this camp
right now, Donnie. A hunk will work if you
show him a pick and shovel, but these other
guys are trouble-breeders. Did you see that
big brute that came in to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald remembered seeing an enormous man
with narrow, piggish eyes, in the crowd of men
sent by the employment agency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s ol’ Hand. He’s a bad egg. I s’pose
I’d ought to fire him, but he’s a good logger,
and they are mighty scarce ’round these diggin’s.”
He yawned sleepily. “Got to fix a ‘spar-tree’
for a ‘high-lead’ to-morrow, so I better hit the
hay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Preparing the “spar-tree” for “high-lead,” or
“sky-line” rigging, is the most spectacular and
thrilling performance in the logging industry.
A standing tree is trimmed of top and branches,
then strengthened with guys. With the pull
coming from this altitude, the advantage over
the straight ground pull is enormous as logs are
lifted high in air over all impedimenta. The
men who do this hazardous work are known as
“high-riggers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning, a man with a short-handled
axe, wearing a wide belt to pass around the treetrunk,
and a pair of lineman’s spurs, slowly
climbed a big fir. As he ascended he trimmed
the trunk clear of limbs. Quite a crowd
gathered, among them the trapper, with his
rifle on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t got a ‘high-rigger’ in the outfit,”
growled Gillis. “This feller agreed to trim her,
but he says he never chopped the top off one,
so I guess we’ll dynamite her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The explosive, with a detonating cap, was tied
around the top of the tree and wires strung to
the ground. For some reason the batteries
would not act, and Gillis chafed under the
delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I kin set her off for ye,” said the old trapper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis turned to him. “How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trapper tapped his gun. “Put a piece
of paper on the cap so’ I kin see her and I’ll
pop it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a new one on me,” laughed Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sent the man aloft to place a square piece
of pasteboard on the cap. The men moved
back from the foot of the tree, and Gillis gave
the signal that all was clear. The old man
sprang briskly to the top of a stump, tipped his
big hat to the back of his head, and raised his
rifle slowly. For an instant the long barrel
wavered slightly, then steadied. The report of
the rifle was drowned by a splintering crash.
The heavily-branched top lifted, then came
hurtling through the air to strike the ground a
mass of wreckage. For a moment the big spar
swayed drunkenly from the shock, then stood
stark and rigid. Deprived of its fronds of green,
it appeared a ghastly relic of its former self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That afternoon, as they waited the arrival of
the train, Gillis talked again of his “redshirts.”
“White men, every one of them,” he declared
proudly, “and every one of them with a nickname
that is known all over the Coast. Ye just
ought to see my two ‘high-riggers,’ ‘Hoop-la’
McKenzie and ‘Blackie’ Anderson. ‘Blackie’ is
as black as an Indian, and ‘Hoop-la’ got his
name from standing on the top of a spar-tree,
after he cuts her off, wavin’ his hat and yellin’
‘Hoop-la’.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got five Jack McDonalds in the gang.
Their names are ‘Sly’ Jack, ‘Fightin’ Jack,
‘Check-Book’ Jack, ‘Johnnie-On-The-Spot,’
and ‘Crazy’ Jack. An’ if they had all bin named
‘Crazy’ Jack it wouldn’t bin no mistake,” he
finished with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train rumbled to the station and the
usual crowd of workers came pouring from the
cars, while a crowd stood waiting to board the
train. It was the same every day—men coming
and men going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis uttered the glad cry, “Here they are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A big, ostentatious man, with broad shoulders
and narrow hips, stepped to the platform. His
dress was truly colourful and striking—wide hat,
high boots, a vivid scarlet shirt, with a cloth belt
of the same bright hue tied at the side, the ends
dangling loosely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get out of the way, hunkies, and make room
for a logger!” he roared, as he elbowed his way
through a crowd of scattering foreigners behind
him, a line of men clad in the same brilliant attire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Hoop-la! you ornery ol’ skate!”
bellowed Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man turned. “Here he is fellers!”
he shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment Gillis was surrounded by this
picturesque crew, howling tumultuous greetings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, ol’ hoss!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, you son-of-a-gun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How the hell are ye?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald was subjected to crushing hand-clasps
as he was introduced to each and every
one of this crowd of husky loggers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Donald studied them he did not wonder
at Gillis’s pride in these men. With the exception
of Blackie, there was none under six feet in
height, and they carried themselves with a loose
swing that was almost a swagger. Many of them
were well past middle age, some quite grey
about the temples. They were all filled with
the sparkling health of the great outdoors, their
skins the colour of mahogany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s the bunk-house?” asked Blackie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t call them bunk-houses any more,
we have dormitories,” corrected Gillis as he
nudged Donald slyly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A what?” questioned the puzzled Blackie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dormitories,” repeated Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackie glowered at his boss. “What are you
runnin’, a ladies’ seminary?” he questioned
sarcastically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And another thing, you don’t need your
blankets. Company furnishes ’em,” informed
Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll tell you one thing right now,”
declared ‘Crazy’ Jack, “I ain’t goin’ to sleep in a
pair of blankets that forty smelly bohunks has
wrapped themselves in. What kind of a joint
you brought us to, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I want to tell you fellers,” said Gillis,
ignoring ‘Crazy’ Jack’s remarks, “is this: I want
you to stay all summer. None of this running
to town to get your teeth fixed, or a new suit,
see the ball game, or to meet your sister who’s
comin’ out from the East, and all that old bunk.
We got more orders——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can that chatter,” interrupted ‘Fighting’
Jack with a wide grin. “We’re all goin’ to
town on Dominion Day, ain’t we, boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet!” they roared as one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis shrugged his shoulders resignedly.
“Thought you fellers was gettin’ old enough
to have a little sense,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too much kick in us yet, Jack,” demurred
Blackie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is this door-mee-tory, Jack?” asked
Hoop-la.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis pointed to the long building, and the
boisterous crowd moved noisily up the hill.
The men dropped their packs to the ground
outside the door, and, shouldering each other,
peered in. The long rows of white beds stood
immaculate against the walls, and two white-coated
flunkeys were sweeping the glossy varnished
floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This ain’t the right place,” growled Hoop-la,
“this is the hospital. They must expect to kill
about a hundred men every day. Hi! Jack!
Come here. Where’s the bunk-room?” he
asked as Gillis approached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say! what you givin’ us? I wouldn’t dare
sit down on one of them beds; ’fraid of dirty’n
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others gathered round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack, can we put up a log shack for ourselves?”
asked Blackie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sure can,” responded Gillis tolerantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, we’ll sleep in this morgue ’till
we get a decent place,” said Blackie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He poked his head in the door just as Andy,
clad in white coat, entered by the rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, nurse,” shouted Blackie, “get ready for
twenty-two cases of delirium tremens!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s easy,” was Andy’s quick retort;
“I’ve ’ad more than that by myself.” His
eyebrows lifted in quick surprise as he saw the
brilliant shirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When does the blinkin’ circus start?” he
grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening in their explorations Blackie and
Hoop-la found the log shack on the lake-shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Jack, can me and Hoop-la have that
cabin down there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet you can, Blackie. You and Hoop-la
can have anythin’ round here,” replied Gillis
heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackie had turned to go, but on hearing this
broad statement he stopped quickly. “Say,
Jack, me and Hoop-la came away from Vancouver
owin’ a little money—an’ I promised to
send——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye’ve got me when the gittin’ is good,”
interrupted Gillis. “How much do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see,” reflected Blackie, “I owe for
my room in town; and I owe at Old Joe’s, and—and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much? Spit it out, I can stand the
shock,” commanded Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Bout a hundred, Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” whistled Gillis as he reached for
his purse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Donald’s assistance the hundred dollars
was found and Blackie ran joyously down the
hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little devil!” smiled Gillis as he gazed
after him. “Good-hearted a feller as ever
lived,” he added feelingly, “but he can’t take
one drink without goin’ crazy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “redshirts” had been up in the woods
looking over the logging operations, and they
now came swinging down the hill, their bright
shirts flashing in the sun. They were loggers,
“every inch of them,” as Gillis had said.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>Andy’s</span> study of nature proved to be no
idle whim, and Gillis had long since ceased
teasing him. All his leisure moments were
spent in scouring the hills and meadows for
specimens, and regularly every Sunday afternoon
he ascended the hill to Wainwright’s cabin with
his collection for the learned Englishman’s
inspection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this afternoon, Wainwright, being in one
of his solitary moods, had wandered up the
mountain, and Andy found Connie busily engaged
in spading the earth in search of worms,
which she tossed to the swarm of birds that
hopped on the ground and filled the air about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scolding the bold camp-robbers that ventured
dangerously near the shovel blade, she scattered
the soil, then laughed joyously as the birds with
a great flutter of wings pounced on the fat worms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy threw himself luxuriously on the green
sward. This beautiful spot was a diversion
from the hot kitchen, a veritable haven of rest.
The gentle murmur of the bees among the
flowers, the soft, subdued twittering of the birds,
the rustle of the leaves, and the laughing of the
water, all combined to make one sweet monotone
of sound that lulled him into drowsiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie sat down near him, the birds all about
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Ow do you get them so tame, Connie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They know that I love them,” she replied
simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t get anything but the camp-robbers
to come near me,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It takes time and patience, Andy. As soon
as the birds are assured that you mean them no
harm, they are eager to be your friends. You’ll
remember, Dad told you that without plants
man could not live,” she went on. “It is
equally true that if all the birds should perish,
man would soon follow. And, still more wonderful,
if we had no insects man could not survive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy came to a sitting posture. “Do you
mean to s’y that we would die if we ’ad no
insects?” he asked incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely, Andy, you haven’t forgotten what
Dad told you last Sunday about the insects
carrying the pollen from flower to flower,”
reproved Connie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ’ave it now!” cried Andy, after a few
moments of reflection. “If we ’ad no insects
to carry the pollen the plants couldn’t live.
And if the birds were all gone ther’d be so many
insects that they’d eat up every blinkin’ thing
the farmers raised, and we’d starve to death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me ’andsome if it ain’t wonderful!”
said Andy in an awed voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie explained very simply to Andy the
benefits derived by mankind from the various
birds. Her discourse proved so interesting to
him that he paid little heed to the time until the
sun, disappearing behind the trees, warned him
that it was time to return to his duties. Regretfully
he arose and turned to the trail, Connie
walking by his side. A goldfinch, rich in his
summer plumage of bright yellow, black and
white, hung swaying like a dainty sprite on a
slender stem near the path. From its bulging
little throat came a rippling, bubbling song like a
miniature torrent of ecstasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, dear, dearie,” he called sweetly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you darling!” cried Connie as she clasped
her hands in rapture. “I’ve been trying to find
their nest for several days, Andy, but the little
dears have hidden it too well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made soft clucking sounds as she moved
nearer to the beautiful bird. The goldfinch fluttered
close to her side to perch like a yellow flower
on the top of a tall thistle, perked its pretty head
and looked up at her with bright shining eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, dear, dearie,” it sang again, then flew
with characteristic wavy motion to a clump of
willows, twittering sweetly as if calling Connie
to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ’ave to ’urry ’ome,” said Andy as he looked
at his watch. He glanced back at a turn in the
trail to see Connie pressing the willows gently
aside in her search for the goldfinch’s nest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me pink! but she is a wonderful girl,”
soliloquized Andy. “The ’andsomest and the
brainiest kid I ever saw in me life. If I was
thirty years younger, two feet ’igher, and ’arf
decent to look at, I’d fall ’ead over ’eels in love
with ’er.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled broadly at these ridiculous reflections,
but there was a tender light in his bright
blue eyes. A swarthy foreign labourer, moving
aimlessly up the trail, merely grunted in reply
to Andy’s cheerful salutation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of Gillis’s beloved bohunks,” chuckled
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later he stopped suddenly. Connie
was up there alone. For a short interval he
hesitated, then resumed his downward journey.
“She’d shoot ’is blinkin’ ’ead off if ’e tried to
’arm ’er,” he decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then he heard Connie’s voice raised in a
quick cry of anger. Andy jumped as though
subjected to a galvanic shock. He turned in
mid-air and before he struck the ground his
short legs were going through the motion of
running. The picture of Connie struggling in
the arms of the burly foreigner made him fairly
fly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m coming, Connie!” he shouted as he
tore up the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald and Gillis, sitting near the bluff
enjoying a smoke came to their feet as they
heard a faint shout from above. For an interval
they listened intently, but hearing no further
sound they resumed their seats. Andy slackened
his pace as he came to the clearing and saw that
Connie was unharmed. She was standing near
the labourer with her head bowed over an object
held in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong, Connie?” panted Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Andy, look!” she choked, “it’s the mother
bird. I had just found her nest—here it is.”
She parted the bushes to disclose a compact,
cosy, cup-like structure of fine grass and moss
placed in a crotch of the tree. In the centre
lay four downy fledglings whose tiny mouths
gaped wide to receive the expected bit of food
from the mother’s bill. “Oh, Andy, if she dies
the little ones won’t live,” said Connie in a voice
filled with pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy took the wounded bird from her hand.
“ ’Ow did it ’appen, Connie?” he asked
tenderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie was as open and unaffected as the
wild birds of the forest. She was as capable of
hating as she was of loving. Her eyes were
laughing eyes, and the soul that looked out of
them a merry soul, but she had a temper, and
under sufficient provocation her blue eyes could
take on a dangerous glow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She now turned like an enraged lioness on the
foreigner. “He killed it with a stick!” she
cried furiously. “You brute, you cowardly
brute.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” In her rage her voice became
incoherent. With hands clenched and with
breath coming in short gasps, she moved nearer
to the object of her hatred. In her hysterical
anger her voice rose almost to a scream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You cur, if I were a man I’d—I’d lick you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cry came to Donald’s ears, and he was off
up the trail like a deer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something wrong, Jack!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead, I’ll follow,” responded Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy looked down on the mother goldfinch as it
lay in his hand. He felt the quick throbbing of its
heart grow fainter and fainter. One wing was
broken and its white breast was stained with
blood. The bird’s head drooped lower, and a
film settled over its bright eyes. The beautiful
wings stretched rigidly, and it gasped convulsively,
sending a tiny stain of crimson from its
mouth that felt warm on his palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s face became colourless. His hand
shook violently as he placed the dead bird
tenderly on the ground. “Connie dear,” he
said, in a voice that trembled, “I ain’t a whole
man, but ’ere’s where you see ’arf a man goin’
into battle to give all he’s got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He removed his coat and threw it from
him. Through a rage-mist Andy saw the grinning
foreigner throw up his arms in an absurdly
unscientific posture of defence. Like a mad cat,
Andy launched himself straight at his husky
opponent. The grin was wiped from the big
man’s face by Andy’s compact fist, as it smacked
resonantly on the end of his thick nose with a snap
like that of a whip, and with a skilled force that
brought blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s years of training boxers now stood
him in good stead. He well knew that a small
man would stand little chance in long range
fighting, and he kept well inside the larger man’s
wild swings. With his blond head tucked
against his adversary’s body, his fists worked like
pistons; he kept sending short jolts to the body
that brought heavy grunts every time they
landed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie was delirious with excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hit him, Andy! Hit him! Good! Good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she groaned as the big man’s hand
found Andy’s throat and flung him to the ground.
Little Andy was up immediately, but stepped
into a swinging fist that caught him over the eye
and sent him sprawling. Undaunted, he came
to his feet, waited warily for an opening, and
again sprang under the big man’s guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s fist shot up in a ripping upper-cut
that was judged to a nicety, catching his opponent
on the point of his chin with force enough to send
him rocking on his heels, and before he could
recover himself the same fist, accompanied by
its mate, beat a tattoo on his solar plexus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In desperation the bewildered man wound his
arms about the little Australian and lifted him
high in air. Like a game bulldog Andy hung on.
Though his feet were off the ground, he clung
to the big man’s body like a leech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the big hands felt for Andy’s throat,
and he was flung six feet to strike with a thump
that shook every bone in his body. Connie
cried out in fear as he narrowly avoided a brutal
blow aimed at his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s sense of British fair play had received
a rude shock. “As Methusalem said,” he
panted, as he came to his feet, “when in
Bohunkia do as the Bohunks do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take that, Spaghetti!” he shouted, as he
kicked the foreigner viciously on the shin.
While the latter leaned over in pain, Andy shot
a well-directed upper-cut to his face. The big
man sat down, a dazed look in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Breathless, Donald arrived on the scene, with
Gillis puffing in the rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Breathing heavily, Andy’s adversary came
to his feet, picked up his hat, and with arms
wound about his head beat a hasty retreat.
Andy was after him like a hornet, sending
stinging blows through his vulnerable guard.
Donald and Gillis stood with mouths agape to
see Andy administering a sound thrashing to a
man twice his size. Right to the edge of the
woods he relentlessly pursued his fleeing enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s head was held at its usual cocky angle,
and he assumed a swagger as he retraced his
steps, but his short legs wobbled and he sank
dizzily to a stump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I brought ’is blinkin’ meat-’ouse down,
Connie,” he gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Andy, you’re a darling!” she cried,
throwing her arms impulsively around the little
man’s neck, and touching her lips to his cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s florid face took on a deeper magenta,
and he blinked hard to hide certain signs of
emotion. He afterwards admitted to Donald
that he was no “sweet sixteen,” and that it
was the first time that he had ever been kissed
in his “bloomin’ ” life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie wet her handkerchief in the cold
water of the creek and bathed his face with
tender care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She showed Donald and Gillis the nest with
the motherless birds, doomed to die a premature
death by this act of wanton cruelty, and pointed
to the tiny bird on the ground, for whose untimely
end Andy had taken a well deserved and summary
vengeance. Connie choked as the lovely
male bird flew to a stalk of goldenrod near its
dead mate and sent out its throaty warble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, dear, dearie,” sang the goldfinch in a
plaintive, questioning note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy presented a pitiful figure with an eye
closed, his lips swollen, and his face bruised,
but the indomitable spirit of him shone from his
one bright orb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You darned little buzz-saw!” said Gillis
tenderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald slapped his little friend on the back,
his eyes shining with admiration.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>Renwick</span> announced that Robert Rennie’s
daughter and a party of girl friends were to
visit Summit Lake the following week, and
carpenters were set to work erecting cottages
for their accommodation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days before her arrival Donald was both
surprised and pleased to receive a cordial letter
from her in which she said that she was looking
forward with pleasure to the coming holiday,
and that she would deeply appreciate anything
he might do for the entertainment of her friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As always, her father spared no expense in
providing for the comfort and pleasure of his
daughter. That week a car containing a motor-boat,
canoes and six saddle-horses was run in
on a side-track at the mill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie learned of the coming event through
Donald as she was watching with keen interest
the unloading of the spirited animals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will enjoy yourself next week, Connie,”
he said gaily. “Miss Rennie is coming with
friends. We’ll have rides, picnics and dancing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later Connie joined Andy, who
sat on the steps of the kitchen door enjoying a
breath of fresh air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Miss Rennie rich, Andy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An ’ole barrel o’ dough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is—is she beautiful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve ’eard so, Connie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short pause ensued while she searched the
pockets of her overalls and produced several
neatly folded papers. She extracted one,
pressed it smooth, then passed it to Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Miss Rennie dress like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a photograph of an actress dressed for
the street, taken from one of the magazines that
Donald had given her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so, Connie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! She must be wonderful, then!” said
Connie earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved closer to Andy, unfolded another
page, and spread it on her knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy bent his blond head close to the one
of gold. A startled look crossed his features
and his brows bobbed up and down. It was a
full-page advertisement of ladies’ lingerie. The
highly coloured illustration of a lady, partially
dressed, achieved its object of arresting the eye,
while the remainder of the space was occupied
by articles of apparel similar to those adorning
the lady’s graceful form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy coughed. “Er—yes, Connie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie raised her eyebrows incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All at one time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure—sure,” mumbled Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie stared. “Why, there must be nearly
a dozen pieces. How is this fastened?” she
questioned as she pointed with a slender brown
finger to one of the engravings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy took a quick glance. “Buttons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buttons,” replied Andy, gripping the bowl
of his pipe and sending out clouds of smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me blind, what a ’ell of an ’ole,”
thought Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buttons,” he responded desperately without
looking at the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie raised her head. “Oh no, I don’t
think so, Andy; that must slip on,” she objected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy made a pretence of studying the article
in question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, sure! That’s right! that’s right!”
he conceded quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s pipe was now sending out billows of
acrid smoke. Connie coughed and moved beyond
the smoke screen. Much to Andy’s relief,
she sat for a moment silently studying the advertisement.
When she raised her golden head there
was a look of wistful yearning in her blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Andy,” she said dreamily, “it must be
lovely to feel those soft silky things next your
skin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m—I’m sorry, Connie,” stuttered Andy,
“but I ’ave a roast in the oven—I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute, Andy,” she pleaded, “there
is something else I want to ask you.” She sorted
the papers for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God ’elp me, what will it be now?” thought
Andy, as he braced himself for the next question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Andy, what is a camisole?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A look of profound relief crossed the little
Australian’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A camisole,” he explained with an air of
wisdom, “is a fish. It’s a——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was interrupted by Connie’s peal of
laughter. “Oh, Andy,” she cried, “you’re a
funny man!” She turned and ran laughing
down the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me lucky!” exclaimed Andy as he
mopped his brow. “It’s enough to make a
blighter’s ’eart bleed. The poor motherless kid
comin’ to a bloke like me to ask such questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched Connie as she slowly ascended
the trail, still studying the magazine pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ’ow the ’ell can I ’elp ’er?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pondered deeply for a moment, but,
seemingly unable to answer the question, shook
his head sadly and turned to his duties.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately for Janet’s peace of mind, none
of her friends had recognized in the photograph
of the new champion of Canada the handsome
young man they had met at her home. They
were puzzled by her decision to spend a holiday
in the wilds until she casually mentioned that
Mr. McLean was arranging for their entertainment,
and she accepted with a smile the sly
teasing that followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party arrived by special train a day earlier
than originally planned, and as Janet stepped to
the platform Donald was for a moment disconcerted
by the warmth of her greeting and the
softness in her eyes as they rested on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That afternoon Connie came riding down the
hill holding in her hand an enormous bouquet
of Alpine flowers. She leaped from her horse
and ran blithely around the corner of the big
building. Andy, dressed in white coat and hat,
came smilingly forward to meet her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Andy, here are some rare flowers Dad sent
for——” She ceased speaking abruptly as
Donald, leading Janet and her friends from a
tour of the kitchen, came through the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s face lighted with a glad smile as he
saw Connie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Rennie, I want you to meet Miss
Wainwright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s face burned with embarrassment as
all eyes turned toward her, and the mass of wild
flowers held crushed to her breast quivered as
though shaken by a breeze. She glanced about
her quickly, strongly tempted to flee the
spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the society belle and the girl
of the mountains eyed each other silently. Janet
stared at Connie as if she were some strange
creature unclassified by science. Connie for the
first time was gazing on a stylishly-clad member
of her own sex. Janet’s dress of white silk
shimmered in the sunshine, and her broad-brimmed
white hat, with lining of pale rose,
gave to her beautiful face a ruddy glow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s eyes roved in admiring awe from the
neat high-heeled shoes to the silken hose and
skirt, and then to the flowered hat set jauntily
on thick shining coils of dark hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a certain dewy freshness, a native
frankness, about the girl of the woods that made
Janet appear artificial. Their eyes met, and
Connie’s lips parted in a timid smile, revealing
two rows of perfect milk-white teeth and forming
two tiny dimples in her brown cheeks. Her
lonely heart longed for the friendship of this
wonderful girl, but the smile quickly faded when
she saw that Janet’s eyes remained cold and
appraising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet scrutinized Connie’s faded blue overalls
and coarse cotton shirt, which, even though
loose and ill-fitting, could not conceal the graceful
lines of the childish figure. Confused by
the cold reception, her eyes wide and misty
with a hint of pain, Connie turned quickly
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moving with the easy grace and freedom that
an empress might envy, Connie walked to the
side of her cayuse, and with characteristic bird-like
motion sprang to his back. Her moccasined
feet struck his sides, and with ears flattened
Pegasus leaped forward with a speed that sent
Connie’s hair streaming. His spurning hoofs
sent a cloud of dust in their faces, then horse
and rider went tearing down the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet stood staring after the flying rider, a
look of blank astonishment on her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s visits to the mill ceased, but from
the highest point on the bluff she watched the
merry-makers with keen interest as, dressed in
natty riding costumes, they rode their stylish
horses, disported themselves in bathing-suits on
the sandy beach, paddled the lake in light,
graceful canoes, or chugged about in the shiny
white motor-boat. For two evenings she sat
with a feeling of dreary lonesomeness while
Donald and Janet floated on the placid lake in
one of the tiny canoes, their subdued voices and
gentle laughter coming up faintly from below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the evenings she spent with Donald,
Janet was assailed by fleeting emotions in which
she tried to define her attitude toward him. She
felt that the time was not far distant when some
definition would be necessary. In a number of
artful ways she had tried, but without success,
to lead him to talk of himself. When she put
a direct question she saw the lines about his
mouth tighten, and his reply carried a tone of
such unmistakable rebuke that her face reddened
and the subject was instantly dropped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the night before Janet’s departure a dance
was arranged, to which the clerical staff of the
Cheakamus Mill was invited. Gillis promised
a special feature on the programme in the form
of an old-fashioned square-dance with his “redshirts”
as the performers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that day the skies drizzled continuously;
lake and mountain were hidden under a heavy
mist. The inclement weather did not dampen
the ardour of the merry crowd, who, in slickers
and oilskins of every description, gathered flowers
and trees to decorate the big dining-room that
was to be used as a dance-hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, lights gleamed from every window
of the big room, which had undergone a sudden
transformation. The walls were one mass of
wild flowers, and on the beams overhead small
cedars and jackpines stood upright in rows,
adding a pungent odour to the air, already burdened
with the sweet smell of wild flowers. The
music of the phonograph flowed out of the open
door to vibrate softly through the dripping trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie learned of the dance, and after dark
she slipped quietly down into the valley. She
crouched by the open window, heedless of the
rain dripping from the eaves, her eyes glued
upon the enchanting scene within. She saw
Donald and Janet gliding across the floor, and
she marvelled at the grace of their movements.
The hum of talk, the constant ripple of feminine
laughter, the rustle of silken skirts, were all
foreign to Connie. She felt a touch of intense
and utter loneliness, like a stranger in a strange
land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet seemed to have thrown aside her cloak
of reserve; she brimmed over with an unwonted
gaiety, but at times her big brown eyes held a
troubled look as they rested on Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis’s “redshirts” filed in to give an exhibition
of old-fashioned dancing. Half the men
wore handkerchiefs tied about their arms to
indicate that they were impersonating ladies.
Blackie played the violin, while “Fightin’ ” Jack’s
roaring voice did the “callin’ off.” Gillis informed
the company that Blackie “didn’t know
a note of music from a post-hole.” But what
he lacked in technical knowledge was made up
in the immense volume of sound he produced
from the instrument, and the speed he set for
the whirling dancers to follow soon had them
dripping with perspiration. There were shouts
of Homeric laughter, big feet thumped the floor
as they girated through the intricate steps of
the quadrille, and above all sounded the hoarse
voice of “Fightin’ ” Jack in the colourful jargon
of “callin’ off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the finish the girls loudly applauded the
efforts of this picturesque crew, and after a
short breathing spell they again took the floor
and danced until sheer exhaustion forced them
to quit. Mopping their dripping faces with big
red bandannas, they trooped boisterously outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near midnight the rain ceased, and as Donald
walked with Janet to her cabin the moon came
suddenly from behind a dark wall of clouds to
set the lake sparkling under its soft light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too wonderful a night to sleep,” said Janet
softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we walk to the lake?” asked Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood near the edge of the lake in the
light of the moon and looked across at the towering
snow-fields etched against the star-spangled
sky. There were lights still shining from the
big room they had just vacated, and the night-watchman’s
lantern bobbed jerkily as he made
his rounds. Across the lake the light from the
trapper’s cabin shone on the calm surface of the
water. The faint, weird call of a loon wafted
to their ears was echoed and re-echoed in soft
cadences from the surrounding hills. A faint
breath of wind came out of the rain-washed
forest, laden with the sweet perfume of earth
and flowers, and caressed their faces like loving
fingers. Donald took a deep breath that seemed
more like a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it beautiful?” He indicated with a
sweep of his arm the lake, the wooded hills and
the glittering glaciers lifting their heads high
to the sparkling firmament. He turned to find
his companion standing with downcast eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you like it?” he asked, a trifle resentfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet raised her head slowly. The limpid
depths of the big brown eyes were soft and
languorous in the half-light; the full red lips
were dewy and tremulous; the peaceful light
of the moon shone upon her radiant upturned
face, giving it an ethereal glow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is wonderful,” she breathed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Involuntarily he moved closer. What was
this inner urge? Love—feeling—emotion, or,
it might be, passion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Laughter and voices came from the trail above.
Douglas with several of the visiting party
emerged into the white light of the moon.
Douglas called his sister’s name and Janet and
Donald moved up the hill to join them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the sound of their footsteps died in the
distance there was a rustle in the bushes near
the path as a slender, childish figure, clad in
blue overalls and cotton shirt, glided into the
soft moonlight. She stood leaning forward
with the grace of some wild thing, her heavy hair
flowing about her shoulders. The big blue eyes
that usually were filled with light and happiness
were now dark with passion, and two small
brown fists were pressed against a wildly-heaving
breast. Tears welled from the blue
eyes and rolled slowly down her cheeks. Her
breath came in gasps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate you! Oh, how I hate you!” She
stamped her tiny moccasined foot passionately,
then turned and ran blindly along the dark
forest trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An owl flew like a ghostly wraith to a thick
growth of firs. The startled cheep of a flying-squirrel
turned to a cry of terror, quickly
silenced by the powerful beak of the owl as it
made its kill. A song-sparrow, with her downy
brood cuddled to her warm breast, heard the
death-cry, and her eyes grew round with terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mallard duck, sleeping quietly on the lake,
emitted a terrified quack as it was drawn below
the surface. A moment later the water was
disturbed as a mink arose, with its sharp teeth
fastened in the duck’s throat, and moved through
widening ripples toward the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quick “plop” of a startled muskrat
sounded sharply on the night air as the Breed
rose slowly from a spot not far from where
Connie had lain in hiding. He stood with
arms folded, the stolid look of the Indian on his
face, and stared toward the spot where Connie
had disappeared. A look of ineffable sadness
was in his sombre eyes. Thus he stood as
immovable as a statue for an interval. Then a
long-drawn sigh escaped him. “She loves
him,” he said in a dead voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked to the shore, his distorted limb
causing him to sway grotesquely in the moonlight.
He drew a skilfully concealed dugout
from the bushes and launched it gently. His
paddle spurned the water noiselessly, and in a
moment he was lost in a bright patch of reflected
moonlight.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>A week</span> before Dominion Day men began
applying for leave of absence until the exodus
depleted the crew to such an extent that it was
deemed advisable to shut down for a week.
Donald turned to Gillis as he saw the whole
crew of “redshirts” pile tumultuously on the
train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How often do the men quit like this?” he
asked rather irritably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every holiday,” replied Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald pondered a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That means that we may lose a week for
Labour Day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack, do you think we could keep them here
if we held some sort of celebration at the lake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe we could,” responded Gillis
warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll do it then,” declared Donald. “We’ve
so many orders ahead that this lay-off may force
us to run a night crew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you spend all your dough, Blackie?”
asked Gillis when the “redshirts” arrived
back from town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me and Hoop-la spent about two hundred
bucks, but we had three hundred dollars’
worth o’ fun. We ain’t got enough money to
buy a humminbird a pair o’ leggin’s, but we
sure had a helluva good time, so we ain’t
worryin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S’pose you bought them new boots?”
inquired Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackie forced a laugh. “Goin’ to git them
next time, Jack,” he continued, moving closer
to his big boss; “say, Jack, you know that I
send twenty dollars to my mother back east
ev’ry month. I—I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Blackie,” said Gillis gently, “I’ll
advance it to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Jack, you’re a good pal,” commended
Blackie in a relieved tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald and Gillis walked down the hill to inspect
the logs in the boom, and as they walked Gillis
indulged in some pointed observations. “You
know, Donnie, that these loggers are game guys
to come back after spendin’ all their money and
say: ‘We had a good time, so we ain’t worryin’.’
The man ain’t human that won’t worry after
spendin’ in a few days the money it’s taken him
six months to earn swingin’ an axe an’ draggin’
a saw. Still, they hide their remorse under a
grin and tell of what a good time they’ve had.
So many people think that loggers spend all
their money for booze. ’Tain’t so. That gang
of mine give away about half their money to
bums around town. I have seen Blackie give
away twenty bucks at a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they passed the high-rigger’s little cabin,
Gillis poked his head through the door. Blackie
was absorbed in the task of sewing a patch on
a pair of worn boots. A mournful wind blew
querulously around the cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Blackie, do you know what that wind
is saying?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackie grunted a negative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s what it’s a sayin’,” said Gillis as he
puckered his lips: “O-o-o-o-h! W-h-e-e-r-r-e-e
has your summer wages gone! O-o-o-h!
W-h-e-r-r-e-e has your summer——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis dodged back as a boot came whizzing
past his head.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Midsummer brought an epidemic of labour
disturbances throughout the Province. A radical
labour organization seized on a time when
work was plentiful and labour scarce to spread
their insidious propaganda through the camps.
Railroad construction in the interior had been
seriously interfered with, and in many cases
there had been violence and bloodshed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two agitators arrived at the Summit Mill, and
the next day several of the men—including
Hand and Blackie—did not appear when the
whistle blew. Gillis found them in Blackie’s
cabin in a half-drunken condition. That afternoon
Renwick ordered the two strangers off the
premises and discharged Hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hoop-la begged successfully for lenience toward
his erring pal. “You know how booze
affects Blackie, Jack,” he pleaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald became aware of a changed bearing
on the part of many of the men. Sullenness
had fallen upon them; discontent manifested
itself, as well as insubordination. That afternoon
spikes driven in the logs wreaked havoc
with the saws and forced a partial shut-down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A committee of four men waited on Renwick
and presented an ultimatum. They demanded
a heavy increase in wages, or they would call for
an immediate cessation of work on the part of
the men they represented. Renwick promptly
refused. In fifteen minutes every man in the
mill except the clerical staff, the mechanics and
the engineer, walked out. In the woods only
Gillis’s “redshirts” remained at work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strikers moved up the track and made
camp on a point of land on the lake-shore. That
night the door of the commissary was prised
from its hinges and a quantity of food stolen,
and the night-watchman put out a fire of incendiary
origin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Renwick, while returning from the power-house,
was shot at twice from ambush. He
wired his resignation to Robert Rennie, and in
terrified haste packed his belongings and left on
the next train. An hour later the agent brought
Donald a telegram:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>Donald McLean</span>,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“Summit Mill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are promoted to position vacated by
Renwick. Refuse strikers’ demands. Ship
at Squamish Oriental order white pine. Utmost
importance lumber loaded within week.
Use every means in power to keep plant
operating.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Robert Rennie.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He passed the message to Gillis. The big
man turned and grasped Donald’s hand in
congratulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll get that order out on time or bust,”
declared Gillis grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald distributed firearms among his loyal
men, and one-half the crew patrolled the plant
while the others slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald had been up the greater part of the
night, and at Gillis’s earnest request he went to
his cabin near midnight. As the door closed
behind him, Connie, with her rifle resting in
the hollow of her arm, rose silently from behind
a tree in the darkness of the hillside and flitted
noiselessly on moccasined feet from stump to
stump. Unseen she reached the corner of
Donald’s cabin, where she sank to the ground
with the soft, slow grace of a nestling bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cheakamus Mill, robbed of man-power,
was forced to cease operations. At the Summit
Mill work went on with such speed as in the
situation Donald was able to induce in the men,
who were on edge. To him it seemed that they
were working on top of a powder mine that
might go off at any moment. He discovered in
himself a faculty to handle men and to raise
them to a fever pitch of enthusiasm—not that
the B.C. logger is a hard man to lift to the
fighting point. His fight against great odds had
gained the sympathy of the loyal—a sympathy
and respect that money could not buy. Gillis’s
gang, with the exception of “Blackie,” remained
fervently faithful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toiling in the hot sun, nearly blinded by
sweat, singing lustily, this gallant crew worked
their twelve hours without a murmur of complaint.
Donald lived on the job, ate on the job,
and all day long he drove his men even as he
drove himself. His rest consisted of such fitful
snatches of sleep as he could steal between his
rounds of the night guards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first move of the strikers was not of open
violence. The haul-back on two of the donkeys
broke without apparent reason; one of the big
saws had been tampered with; Wilkinson reported
two fires of incendiary origin, and also
that an attempt to dynamite the power-house
had been frustrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the third morning Hand, at the head of
a mob of fifty men, made a swift descent on
the lumbering operations. It might have been
successful if Donald had not expected something
of this kind and set efficient watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The invaders came down the track in a solid
body, armed with cant-dog handles, pick-axes
and clubs, and thirsting for battle. At Donald’s
quick shout of warning his men dropped their
tools and came on the run to form in a compact
body behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t use your guns unless you have to,”
he warned, as he noticed several of them flash
their revolvers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald climbed quickly to the top of a large
stump. In his left hand he held a stick of
dynamite with fuse attached; in his right he
held a match close to the dangling fuse. “Men,”
he cried in a determined tone, “if you move
forward one step I will throw this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To hell mit him!” shouted Hand. “He
don’t dare do it. Rush him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the mob did not obey their leader’s rash
command. Donald’s pale face and burning
black eyes were sufficient evidence that he
made no idle threat. Donald saw the big
hand of his foreman stealing to the butt of
the heavy Colts that hung at his side. “Keep
cool, Jack,” he begged; “don’t start anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For days Gillis had been without sleep. He
turned bloodshot eyes on Donald. “By G——!
I would like to take a crack at Hand,” he said in
a voice thick with rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hostile crowd did not advance; neither
did they leave. Scattered in groups, they
lay or sat on the hillside to shout occasionally
words of derision at Donald’s faithful
crew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s nerves were on edge. At any
moment there might be a pitched battle with
loss of lives. He studied the faces of the strikers
to see how many were from his crew, and was
surprised to recognize fully forty of his men.
He saw “Blackie” in the rear of the crowd of
strikers. When his eyes met Donald’s he turned
away shamefacedly. All the men from his camp
refused to meet his gaze squarely. “Those men
are ready to come back right now,” he said to
Gillis. “Hand has bullied them into this.
Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” answered Gillis. “I never
thought Blackie would go back on me. I’ll
wring his d——d neck when I catch him in
town!” he added bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald heard a slight movement behind him,
and turned to see Connie standing with her rifle
in the crook of her arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens! Connie, you shouldn’t be
here!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s face bore traces of weariness and
sleeplessness. For three nights she had stolen
softly away from her cabin on the hillside to lie
hidden outside that of Donald. By night she
had kept up a weary vigil, ever on the alert; in
the forenoon she had lain behind a stump on
the hill with eyes on Donald’s tall figure whenever
he came in sight, her rifle ready for instant
action. Hand did not know that death had
nearly claimed him when he stepped forward to
urge his men to charge. At that crucial moment
Connie’s rifle was aimed at his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get away from here at once, Connie!” said
Donald, firmly, but kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie lowered her eyes to her moccasined
foot, that was weaving patterns in the dry soil,
and shook her small head obstinately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you wish to stay?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She patted the stock of her rifle. “I—I want
to help you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald looked down at the weary little
figure. He stepped down from the stump,
keeping a wary eye on the belligerent strikers,
and came to her side. “Connie,” he said
softly, “you are a dear, brave little girl, but you
must get away from this place, as there may be
serious trouble. Please, Connie,” he entreated,
reaching out a hand to stroke her shining hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s face paled quickly, and she shrank
from the caress. Her slender body trembled
at his touch, and his display of tenderness
brought a sudden rush of tears to her eyes.
But she made no move to leave the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finding that he could not shake Connie’s
determination to stay, Donald returned to the
vantage point of the stump. “Jack,” he said,
turning to his big foreman, “I am going to
make one last appeal to these men. If I am
any judge of human nature about half of them,
if they can save their faces, will welcome the
chance to go back to work. They are being
dominated by Hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis shrugged his shoulders. “Do what
you think best,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald passed the dynamite to Gillis and
stepped forward with his arms extended, palms
upward. The crowd moved uneasily. Hand
came slowly to his feet, his small eyes narrowed
with suspicion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up?” he growled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men,” Donald began in a high clear voice,
“I would like to convince you that you will
gain nothing by your present tactics. Bloodshed
will surely ensue. I have orders to refuse
your exorbitant demands. Personally, I have
no choice in the matter; there is no other course
for me to pursue. In spite of your interference
we will continue working with the few men
who have remained loyal. I will ask for police
protection only as a last resort. I appeal
particularly to the men who worked for me here
at this camp. Is there one of you who can
truthfully say that you were not accorded fair
treatment? Is there one of you who will not
admit that the general equipment for your
comfort is unequalled in any camp in British
Columbia? You are making a mistake, men,”
he went on in a pleading tone, “a mistake you
will be sorry for later, for you will be blacklisted
in every camp in the country. Go back
to work, and I promise you there will be no mark
against you. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald walked back to Connie’s side. The
men had not interrupted him once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hand turned to the wavering crowd. “To
hell mit him and all capitalists!” he snarled.
He turned to shake a huge fist at Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You treaten us, do you? You d——” The
epithet that came from his coarse lips was one
that would cause any decent man to see red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald stiffened. His face turned livid. “You
dirty cur!” he flamed. “Don’t you know that
there is a lady present? You apologize to this
little girl or I will whip you within an inch of
your life!” His voice trembled with passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady,” scoffed Hand, “vat you call a
lady? She moost be nice lady, runnin’ in de
woods wit’ you ev’ry Sunday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A murderous look shot from Donald’s dark
eyes. A terrible rage possessed him, a rage
that made his blood feel hot in his veins and
gave him the unnatural strength of a madman.
A dull red flamed in Connie’s tanned cheeks.
She sat down and covered her hot face with her
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy now came running from the cook-house,
dressed in white cap and apron, his
rifle trailing at his side. “What’s goin’ on,
Donnie?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald did not answer. Gillis spoke to Andy
in an undertone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God, Donnie, ’e’s twice your size!
Don’t fight ’im!” implored Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll kill him!” rasped Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis seized his arm. “Let me fix the
d—— skunk; he’s nearer my size.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, this is my affair!” shaking himself
from the grasp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of a paddle came from below,
and the trapper sprang from his dugout and came
swiftly up the hill. As Andy briefly explained
the situation the old man’s grey eyes narrowed
to mere slits beneath the shaggy brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” he breathed. “Me and ‘Betsey’,”
patting his six-shooter, “we likes to shoot up
bohunks. We shoots them in the heel so’s to
save their clothes.” His mouth was set in a grim
smile, a smile that was belied by the steely look
in his deep-set eyes. He seated himself on a log
and placed his gun on his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald had by this divested himself of coat
and shirt and now stepped forward dressed in
light cotton trousers, a sleeveless undershirt
and moccasins. “Hand,” he said in a steady
voice, “this is between you and me. See to it
that your men do not interfere; I will vouch for
mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big foreigner was rubbing his big hands
as though in pleased anticipation. “I suppose
you know how we iss goin’ to fight? Everything
goes, you know.” His grin was fiendish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald knew what was meant. There were
to be no rules of combat; no time duration; no
referee; no rounds, and woe to the man who
should go down. It was to be a battle as of
primeval man. It might result in terrible injury
and mutilation. He sickened at the thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hand stripped to the waist. Connie’s eyes
rested on the mighty frame of this huge blond;
the bunched and rippling muscles, the great
chest covered with a mat of thick hair, and
the enormous limbs. Her glance then turned
and roved to the man who was to fight for
her honour. Donald’s eyes were like burning
coals. His face had regained its colour, but was
contorted with a passion that made him seem
unnatural. Yet he appeared a mere stripling
in comparison to his burly antagonist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Connie became a primitive
woman. She felt as though she could rend and
tear. Her eyes darted blue lightnings of wrath
toward the man who had insulted her, and
her small hands clinched in impotent fury. Her
nails cut into her palms as she exercised every
ounce of self-control to keep from screaming
aloud. Donald was fighting for her. She caught
her breath in a quick stab. Her heart was
beating with alternate throbs of joy and fear.
A sudden fit of trembling seized her, and her
head felt light and giddy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hand’s reputation as a rough and tumble
fighter was well known throughout the Province.
It was his proud boast that he never had been
whipped. He advanced now, a sinister leer on
his face. Andy ran to Donald’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Box ’im, Donnie,” he whispered. “Don’t
let ’im get ’old on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You goin’ to vip me? De dude goin’ to
vip me? Ach!” scoffed Hand in guttural
accents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came slowly forward with arms spread wide,
his thick fingers working convulsively. Donald
leaned slightly forward and waited. As he
neared him, Hand tore in, sure of himself in the
rough and tumble. Donald side-stepped the big
man’s first rush and shot his left to his face. He
was not properly set for the blow, but it stung
Hand to madness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ach!” he grunted, “stand and fight you
d—— coward!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came on, his arms swinging wildly.
Leaping aside, Donald’s heel struck a stump,
and before he could regain his footing the
giant’s arms were around him in a bone-crushing
grasp. His hands were clasped at Donald’s
waist, and the big head was pressed suffocatingly
against his throat. Donald was forced slowly
backward to strike the ground with a thud, the
big man on top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I got you!” panted Hand as he released
his hold on Donald’s waist and aimed a blow at
his face. With a quick movement the under
man turned face down. Hand struck him
viciously as he lay prostrate under him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s eyes were wide with horror, and a
muffled scream escaped her lips as the blow fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a quick, convulsive movement of his
lithe body Donald threw Hand from his back
and sprang to his feet. Whirling quickly as the
foreigner came toward him, he sent in a volley
of blows to his opponent’s face. Hand staggered,
but did not fall. His lips were cut and bleeding:
his nose was broken; and he spat out several
broken teeth. Any one of the blows landed was
sufficient to send an ordinary man down for the
count, but still the gargantuan giant came on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In and out Donald flashed, his arms moving
like steel pistons. Hand could not keep away
from the punishing left hand of his lighter
opponent. Men not trained in the science
of boxing have no punishing power in their
left hand, but depend solely on their right.
Such was the case with Hand. His style did
not vary for a moment. With head lowered
between his powerful shoulders, he would bore
in, swinging wildly in the hope of landing a
lucky punch, or striving to get a hold on his
adversary. Donald’s hand kept beating a tattoo
on his rock-like jaw, but still Hand came forward,
slowly and relentlessly as a steam-roller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crowding Donald back to the line of tense
spectators, Hand rushed him into the scattering
crowd and seized him in a rib-cracking
embrace. Donald broke the hold, but not
before the brute had butted him over the eye.
With the blow Donald’s senses reeled and the
blood gushed from a wide gash on his brow.
A blow from the foreigner’s big fist then caught
him over the heart and sent him staggering to his
knees. With a curse the big man came after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy shouted hysterical words of advice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald came slowly to his feet and mechanically
side-stepped as Hand came stumbling
toward him. Donald evaded him until his head
cleared, and then summoned his remaining
strength into one mighty blow that landed flush
on his opponent’s midriff. The blond beast
came to his knees with a dull grunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go after him!” yelled excited voices from
the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald stepped forward with fist drawn back
to strike the kneeling man, but his arm fell to
his side and he shook his head. “Get up!”
he commanded hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the strikers gasped their appreciation
of this honourable act. A murmur of applause
came from both sides. The foreigner shook
his shaggy blond head and came uncertainly
to his feet and the sanguinary battle went on.
Both men were tired. Hand’s breath was
coming in short, choking gasps from his tortured
lungs, and his face was one smear of blood.
Donald’s left eye was closed; his lips were
split, and the gash over his eye had covered his
body with blood. His arms were tired from
pounding the iron jaw of his adversary. The
big logger’s strength was waning; the pounding
administered by Donald was beginning to tell.
But Donald was too weak to avoid his rushes.
In a clinch Hand again butted him with his
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackie, his eyes blazing, leaped forward with
a peavy handle in his hand. “You fight fair,
d—— you, or I’ll brain you!” he shouted.
One of the strikers attempted to wrest the peavy
handle from his hands. Blackie felled him with
a blow of his fist. It looked for one tense
moment as if there would be a general mêlée.
There came sullen mutterings from the crowd of
strikers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back!” John Hiller’s voice rang out sharp
and clear. “I’ll kill the first man that interferes!”
The eyes shining over the long-barrelled
Colt held a dangerous glint. The men
who had moved to the centre backed away
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back and forth the combatants struggled,
neither gaining any decided advantage, each
trying to land a blow that would end the battle.
Reeling, gasping, striking, falling to their knees
from sheer weakness, the men fought on under a
burning noonday sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No knight of old ever fought more nobly for
a fair lady’s honour than did Donald McLean
that day by the lake-shore. His undershirt
was torn to tatters, showing his white skin
blotched with welts and bruises. He was losing
his sense of distance. Swinging wildly with his
left, his wrist struck Hand’s adamantine jaw
and the onlookers saw his face writhe in pain
as the arm fell helplessly to his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’E’s broken ’is ’and,” groaned Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, stop it, Andy, please stop it!” sobbed
Connie, her arms held out in entreaty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s face turned a sickly grey, and as
the well-nigh sightless foreigner staggered
weakly toward him, he with a strength born of
agony whipped his right to his opponent’s
sagging jaw. The big man faltered, sank slowly
to hands and knees, then stretched at full length,
his face pressing the soil, quivered and lay still.
No sound came from the crowd. The thing
had been too stupendous for immediate shouting
or applause. Donald stood for an instant
swaying uncertainly, then turned to stumble
toward his cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackie sprang to the top of a stump and swung
his hat in the air. “Three cheers for our boss!”
he yelled wildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A roaring cheer came from the crowd with a
right good will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys, let’s go back to work!” shouted
Blackie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re with you, Blackie!” they answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis reached Donald’s side as he tottered
into the cabin and caught him in his arms as he
collapsed into unconsciousness. The big man
picked him up tenderly and placed him on the
bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get some ’ot water and towels and telephone
for Dr. Paul,” commanded Andy tersely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Gillis left to fill Andy’s commission, Connie
fell on her knees by the bedside and wept with
wild and passionate violence. “Oh, Donald!
Donald!” she sobbed, “you fought for me.
I love you! I love you! Oh, Andy,” turning
her streaming eyes to the little man, “he won’t
die, will he? Tell me he won’t die!” Her
trembling fingers were smoothing Donald’s dark
hair, and she kissed his battered face tenderly,
all the while calling his name hysterically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With tears in his eyes and a heart full of
sympathy, little Andy looked down on the
recumbent form of his unconscious friend.
“ ’E’s all right, Connie. ’E’ll be all right in a
few days,” he answered her in a choking voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald stirred as Andy applied the water,
and his one good eye opened slowly. “Did I
win?” he questioned weakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet your blinkin’ life you did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Donald’s gaze rested on Connie his
face twisted into a wry smile. He reached for
her hand and held it in a firm pressure. “Good
little sport,” he whispered through split lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie felt as though her heart would burst.
Scorching tears ran down her face, and it was
with the utmost difficulty that she controlled
the suffocating sobs that filled her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of the big mill whistle smote their
ears in a wild medley of short, sharp blasts,
quite unlike the decorous tone that summoned
and dismissed the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” asked Donald, attempting to
sit up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The engineer is celebrating, Donnie. The men
’ave returned to work. The strike is broken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” sighed Donald happily as he fell
back on the pillows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distant hum of a gas-car gradually
increased to a series of staccato explosions, then
died out suddenly. They heard the light rumble
of wheels as it drew to a stop at the station below.
There was the sound of quick footsteps on the
board sidewalk and the door opened to admit Dr.
Paul. He crossed the room and took Donald’s
hand. “Is it true,” he asked incredulously,
“that you whipped Ole Hand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me pink if ’e didn’t,” Andy vouchsafed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have patched up Hand’s victim’s many
times,” the doctor stated, “but this is the first
time that I have attended his victor, and I can
assure you that it’s a pleasure.” He removed his
coat and rolled up his sleeves. “I’ll look you
over,” he added, then glanced significantly at
Connie, who rose and left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A couple of cracked ribs, a fractured ulna, and
a few hundred bruises,” was the doctor’s verdict
a few minutes later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physician’s deft hands soon bandaged
the broken ribs and set the bone of the forearm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go and patch up the fallen bully. I hope
he’s worse still,” he chuckled as he left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stepped to the door and called in
Connie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t look so frightened, Connie,” smiled
Donald. “I don’t feel half as bad as I look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have to go now,” she said in a voice
choked with emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy accompanied her outside the door.
“ ’Ave a bite to eat, Connie?” he invited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie shook her head. Now that the excitement
was over, the strain of the emotion she had
experienced showed in the dark shadows under
her eyes and in the droop of her slight shoulders.
“Andy,” she began, as she placed a small hand
on his arm, “you—you won’t say anything what—what—I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flood of rose dyed her tanned cheeks and
her blue eyes fell in embarrassment. Andy
patted her shoulder reassuringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll never s’y a blinkin’ word, Connie;
an oyster’s got nothin’ on me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie, visibly relieved, picked up her gun
and started up the hill. Andy watched the
pathetic little figure until she disappeared in the
woods. For a moment he stood staring into
nothingness, then, shaking his head sadly, he
entered the cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a little brick, Andy,” Donald spoke
weakly from his bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy glared at him. “Brick!” he repeated
sarcastically. “Is that all? You big, bone-’eaded,
blinkin’ boob!” He slammed the door
as he went out to give emphasis to the remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the devil does he mean?” puzzled
Donald. He turned painfully to his side, yawned
equally as painfully, then fell into a sound
sleep.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>On</span> the third day of Donald’s convalescence he
was able to leave his cabin. With his arm in a
sling, his face patched with plaster, he made
the rounds of the mill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men welcomed him with eager nods and
smiles, many coming forward to shake his hand
in silent respect. The big plant was now going
at full blast. Belts flapped, logs thudded, planers
snored loudly, and the great saw ripped shrilly
through the big logs in a raising crescendo of
sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down at the siding an engine bumped noisily
into a long string of flat-cars piled high with
lumber. With arms akimbo, his wet undershirt
clinging to his powerful torso, the mop of
blond hair hanging damp on his brow, Gillis
stood surveying the heavily-laden cars with an
air of complacency. The lumber handlers sat
about in positions of weariness, mopping their
hot faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis smiled cheerfully as Donald approached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good news for you, Donnie,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last load for the big steamer,” replied
Gillis, as he pointed at the moving train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re on time, then,” cried Donald gladly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One day ahead,” corrected Gillis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The engineer came to the cab window as the
engine passed, and pantomimed his congratulations
by shaking hands with himself. The train
gathered speed, and as the caboose rattled by,
the conductor came to the rear platform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good work, boys!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood watching the train until it struck
the down grade and disappeared through the
cut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s over,” observed Gillis, as he sat
down heavily and wiped the sweat from his face.
He looked tired and worn, but the light of victory
shone in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it hadn’t been for you, Jack,” said Donald
earnestly, “we would not have got that order
away on time. You look all in; you’d better
have a good sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man’s eyes brightened at Donald’s
praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t look like you’d bin to a Sunday-school
picnic,” replied Gillis with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Donald walked up the hill the whistle blew
for the noon-hour, and the men trooped past on
their way to the dining-room. Blackie left the
ranks and walked shamefacedly to Donald’s
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry for the part I took in the strike,
boss, I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, Blackie,” interrupted Donald,
“you more than made up for it. We’ll forget
all about that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackie’s face wore a relieved look as Donald
gave his hand a friendly grip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meals in logging camps are eaten in silence
and with a fixity of purpose. It is a business to
be finished with as hurriedly as possible. From
the time the men are seated until the chairs are
pushed back, the clatter of dishes and an occasional
“pass the butter” are the only sounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Donald moved to his place at the table the
men arose and clapped their hands. Someone
called for a cheer, but Donald laughingly held
up his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men, I can’t find words to tell you how much
I appreciate your good work. Your long hours
of labour enabled the Company to get an important
order away on time, thereby saving their
prestige in a big Eastern market. You will
receive double pay for every hour you worked
during the week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A low murmur of applause followed this
welcome announcement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After lunch, feeling the need of exercise,
Donald made his way slowly down the hill. The
severe mauling and the days in bed had weakened
him to such an extent that he was forced to take
frequent rests. As he turned a curve in the
trail, Hand and the man with whom Andy had
fought crawled stealthily from the bush, looked
furtively about them, then followed Donald down
the hill. He reached the open glade by the
fairy nest to find Connie seated by the rippling
stream, her chin resting in cupped hands, and
staring dreamily into the flashing water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” he cried gaily, “I have caught my
little dryad at her orisons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sound of his voice Connie sprang to
her feet, her heart racing madly. Hearing a
sound behind him, Donald turned to find the
eyes of the Breed fixed on him in a malignant
glare that chilled him to the marrow. For a
short interval the dusky orbs of the Indian held
his as though with a hypnotic power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” he ejaculated, as the Breed hobbled
down the trail, “your guardian sure does give
me an awful look. Why does he hate me,
Connie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joe has peculiar ways,” she parried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were you dreaming about, Connie?”
he asked interestedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gay light danced momentarily in her shining
eyes, and the red lips curved in a smile; “I was
dreaming I was rich,” she archly confessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An old, old dream,” smiled Donald as he
stretched himself painfully on the moss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie sat down near him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As always, this spot gave Donald a restful
feeling. The gentle zephyrs wafted from the
woods about them were somnolently delicious
and the sparkling glacial stream that rippled
through the glade sang its clear, sweet song.
He closed his eyes wearily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proximity of the man she loved, lying
there with his arm in a splint, his handsome face
still bearing the marks of the blows he had
suffered in her defence, thrilled Connie to the
depths of her warm, impulsive heart. An
almost overmastering desire to touch his hair
possessed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you do if you were rich,
Connie?” he queried drowsily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie sank back in the delicious moss and
clasped her hands behind her golden head. “I’d
buy a big trunk—one of that kind with the
bulgy top—and I’d fill it with silks, satins,
brocades, velvets and all kinds of soft frilly
things. Then I’d unpack it slowly one by one
and hang them up all around the room and sit
down and look at them. I’d buy a great, big
stone house in London, and I’d walk down the
wide marble stairs, trailing a long rustling silk
gown, and I’d raise my lorgnette to my eyes and
say, ‘James, have the carriage at the door in half-an-hour.’
I’d have a country place in Scotland,
with hundreds of dogs and horses, thousands of
birds, and acres of flowers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d take Dad and Peggy with me everywhere
I’d go,” she went on softly, “and I’d buy Dad
millions of books, and for Peggy I’d buy a solid
gold-mounted bridle, and lots of warm blankets
for winter instead of those old sacks. I’d buy
lots of good things to eat, and lots of good
clothes for all the poor kiddies in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at the hills. “And six months
out of every year,” she continued, “I’d live right
here in these mountains and come every day and
sit beside—beside—this stream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised herself slowly and looked down at
Donald as he lay with closed eyes. Leaning
forward until her golden curls almost brushed
his dark hair, her eyes rested on a purple bruise
on his brow. “And,” she finished fiercely, “I’d
kill every man like Ole Hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald laughed sleepily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Connie, you are a dear little girl,” he said
tenderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The endearing tone held a paternal ring, and
Connie bit her lip in vexation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to have you and your father go with
me to Vancouver some day. Will you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Connie was silent. “When—when
my dreams come true,” she responded
with an embarrassed smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he told her of the city and its ways and
the things people did. She listened, not with
amazement, but with a contented smile, as
though what he told her was a confirmation of
her dreams. But when he told her of the grand
opera, the music, the costumes and the singing,
her grey eyes wide with longing, she sighed
deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s voice trailed to a drowsy close; his
chest rose and fell regularly, his features relaxed.
He felt as though he were floating, exquisitely
floating, on a sea of fleecy clouds that was bearing
him softly away. A delicious langour enthralled
him—an enchantment drowsy and dim. He felt
himself drifting, drifting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He was asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The willows at the lower end of the meadow
were pushed cautiously aside, and Hand’s head
appeared in the opening. For two days he had
lain hidden awaiting an opportunity to waylay
Donald. The day after the fight he had boarded
the train for the Coast, but had slipped from the
car at the station below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face—unprepossessing at its best—was
now a horrible sight. The thick lips were swollen
and cracked, the eyes discoloured and puffed,
and the broken teeth bared in a snarl as he saw
Donald lying by the stream. Every hour since
the fight Hand’s hatred for Donald had grown
blacker. He would show him that he, Ole
Hand, deserved his reputation as a fighter. He
would hold this crippled man helpless while he
showered blows on his unprotected face, make
him cry out for mercy on bended knees; perhaps
kill him. His hatred grew hotter and deeper as
he watched him lying peacefully beside the girl
who had been the cause of the fight in which he
had been ignominiously whipped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie sat gazing intently down on the
sleeper. A sudden thought seized her, bringing
a warm flush to her cheeks. Why not? No
one would ever know. Would she dare? She
glanced timorously about her, then leaned
slowly over, her curls falling about her
face, and touched her soft lips to Donald’s
cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bluejay screamed derisively. Connie came
to her feet, her face crimson. Donald stirred,
opened his eyes, and painfully raised himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, Connie,” he apologized, “it
was very rude of me to go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later he walked down the hill.
Connie accompanied him a short distance, then
turned up a steep path, and from a high, rocky
ridge she watched his retreating figure as he
turned toward the dam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A huge bucket on a cable, that had been used
during construction for carrying men and
material across the roaring chasm below the
falls, still hung above the boiling waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Donald there was a certain thrill, a keen
exhilaration, in swinging in mid-air in this
crude conveyance. He stepped into the bucket
and with his one good arm pulled it along the
rusty cable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Breed, hidden near the trail, saw Donald
as he walked toward the dam. The venomous
look in his eyes gave place to one of strained
interest as he saw the two men skulking menacingly
after the unsuspecting man. With a
feeling of malignant exultation, as he sensed
disaster to the man he hated, he hobbled to the
trail and furtively followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the heights above Connie saw the
sneaking figures as they crouched low against
the edge of the dark spruces and at once divined
their murderous object. For an instant she was
paralyzed with terror. Her lips refused to
move and her limbs grew numb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men moved cautiously as they approached
their intended victim, fearing that he might be
armed. As Hand saw Donald suspended over
the river a look of fiendish elation crossed his
features. Here was a chance to dispose of his
enemy with no trace of the crime. He tore
a fire-axe from the wall of the tool-house and
ran to the swaying cable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Breed heard Connie’s piercing scream of
terror above the sound of crashing waters.
He glanced up to see her silhouetted against the
blue sky, her arms waving frantically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joe! Joe! Stop them! Stop them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Screaming again, she plunged straight down
the hillside in a mad race to reach the scene of
action. Running like a deer, stumbling and
falling, her breath coming in short gasps, she
ran wildly on. Snarls of the thorny crab-apple
tore at her, devil’s-club lacerated her face
and hands, but she felt no pain. “O God,”
she prayed aloud, “help me save him! Help
me save him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s face blanched at the sound of the
axe as it bit into the heavy wire cable. He
looked down at the jagged rocks and seething
waters below. Then with closed eyes and a
prayer on his lips he tore in mad frenzy at the
rope. Desperately he tugged with both hands,
although the pain from his broken wrist sent a
wave of torment up his arm that sickened him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No man can measure the speed of thought in
a crisis; even the sluggish brain of the Breed
functioned rapidly. Connie was not for him.
Her happiness was bound up in the man working
feverishly at the haul-back. There was not
one chance in a million that he would gain the
safety of the cliff before the strands parted to
plunge him to eternity. As he heard the crashing
of Connie’s slender body as she tore down the
hill, a softness crept into his eyes. With a speed
incredible in one with his pitiful deformity, he
ran in a series of bounding steps to the edge of
the bluff. The noise of tumbling waters
drowned the sound of his approach. Just as
Hand raised his axe for the final blow, the
muscular arms of the Breed were flung about
him. Emitting a startled curse, the big man
turned and with a twist of his powerful shoulders
flung his dusky assailant to the ground. As
he rose Hand swung viciously at him with
the axe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a quick movement the Breed dodged,
and the weapon flashed over his head, flew from
the big man’s hands, and struck his confederate,
a glancing blow on the shoulder that brought
from him a howl of pain. Again the Breed’s
arms closed about his adversary’s waist. Mad
with the pain in his shoulder, the foreigner drew
a long, keen knife, circled warily about the
two wrestling men until he found an opening,
then plunged the knife to the hilt in the Breed’s
left side. The stricken man slithered from his
opponent’s arms and fell a crumpled heap to the
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sick and giddy, Donald stumbled from the
bucket, seized the axe and advanced weakly
toward Hand. Hand’s accomplice, taking one
look at the prostrate body, turned and fled
terror-stricken to the woods. Hand hesitated
for a moment, then followed heavily after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment, Connie, with clothes torn and
hair dishevelled, broke from the woods, and
with a cry of pity flung herself to the ground
by the Breed’s side and placed his head on her
lap. The eyes of the wounded man flickered
slowly open. He tried to speak, but a strong
convulsion shook his frame from head to foot
and he writhed in desperate agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s face as she lifted it to Donald was
drawn with grief. “Get me some water, please,”
she said brokenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dying man’s lips moved. Connie leaned
closer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I—love you,” he whispered faintly, “I—saved
him—for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A ghastly pallor spread over his features and
his lips were widely parted in a struggle for
breath. Again his lips moved in a fluttering
whisper. “Connie—will—you—kiss me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Connie pressed her tear-wet face to his
the pain-contorted features relaxed in a smile
of wonderful peace and his eyes closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Donald returned Connie’s head was
bowed and she was weeping softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is he, Connie?” he questioned gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald removed his hat and knelt with
bowed head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He died for me,” he choked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And for me,” she whispered inaudibly.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>Lest</span> we tire of monotony, Nature gives us a
change of colour for each of the flowering
seasons. Flowers of every hue may be found
through the different months. Pink for May,
red for June, blue and pink for July, and during
August royal robes of gold and purple clothe
the hills and valleys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last week of August brought to Summit
Lake a pageantry of colour that the Coast
region is denied owing to the persistent rains
that retard the ripening of the leaf. The deciduous
trees were already withdrawing their life-giving
fluid from the leaves to store it in their
roots until spring. The willow, vine maple,
birch and alder along the creeks and lake-shore
held touches of autumnal colouring; while on
the hills the yellowed leaves of the cottonwood
were brilliant in their setting of sober dark
green conifers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gaudy red were the vine maples, but there
was a leafy beauty greater than theirs. The
flowering dogwood blazed from every nook and
cranny. The ripening of the dogwood gives to
its leaves a flame that burns with a fierce glow;
a glow that further ripening deepens until
its crimson flush becomes the loveliest hue of
the British Columbia woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fireweed, or willow herb, that in July
gives to the open spaces a gorgeous tint of bluey
pink, were now loosing a flock of seeds to float
away like tiny parachutes. Each small bit of
fluff held a minute germ of life that would build
a plant as large as its parent when, dropped by
the friendly wind, it reaches a fertile spot. The
stately cottonwood were sending out a life-fluff
as tiny as that from the smaller plants. Thistles,
cat-tails and asters hurried to join the silken
clouds until the air was misty with these germ
balloons, seeking their winter’s rest. The red
elderberry and its magenta neighbour, the thimble
berry, with its truculent Scotch cap, gave to the
woods a material flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A curious timidity had come over the birds;
not only were they quiet, but they were no longer
to be found in their usual haunts. In some
retired spot they were moulting. While the
weather was at its best, and food was the most
plentiful, they were dressing themselves in a new
set of feathers for their long flight to the south.
The tops of the tall pines were filled with sweet
twitterings, of flutterings out and in, wing
trails and quick short flights. A flock of waxwings
had gathered for the migration. They
would not leave for some time yet, but the change
had come. Birds from the north had arrived,
creeping south by easy stages, taking plenty of
time in their journey—the freest creatures that
live, staying or going as they feel inclined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wild berries, dead ripe, hung on lush drooping
branches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A soft “prut-prut-kwit-kwit” came from the
leader of a covey of willow grouse that were
feeding on the tiny fruit of a crab-apple tree.
The call was answered by a shyer note from one
of the young birds, who probably was being
taught the scale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The summer had been one of exceptional
dryness. For weeks there had been no rain,
and a blazing hot sun had poured its fiery rays
from a cloudless sky. The heavy mountain dews
could not penetrate the close standing timber,
and the carpet of needles and moss became dry
as tinder. A pall of smoke, from fires raging
on the Coast, hung over lake and mountain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Wilkinson and his men these were anxious
days. They covered the section between the
mill and Squamish twice a day; scanning the
hillsides and valleys, ever watchful, ever on the
alert; pleading and exhorting the settlers and
loggers to greater vigilance, and all the while
praying fervently for rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald had posted a notice that any employee
found smoking in the woods would be immediately
dismissed. Logging creates a vast
amount of débris, or “slash,” as it is known to
the men of the woods. With the assistance of
the Forestry men, Donald’s crew had piled
enormous heaps of slash on the hillside, awaiting
a favourable opportunity to burn. These menacing
piles of brush, extending along the main
road for a quarter of a mile, were a constant
source of danger. Every precaution, therefore,
was taken. The spaces between the mounds
of brush were raked clean, the road was patrolled
day and night, and pails filled with water were
placed at regular intervals. Special notices
stating the great danger of fire, and warning not
to smoke in this area, were posted conspicuously
on tree and stump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mill at Cheakamus had closed. Sparks
from the donkey engines had threatened the
extinction of both plant and timber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald with Wilkinson stood surveying the
piles of dangerous waste. “If a fire starts and
we can get to it at once, we will be all O.K.”
said Wilkinson, “but if it ever gets away from
us here,” pointing down the road, “no human
agency can stop it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They made the rounds of the patrol to satisfy
themselves that the watchmen were attending to
their duties. Leaving the main road, they
scrambled through the tangled masses of tree-tops
to ascertain how far distant the slash
had been removed from the standing timber.
Suddenly a tiny wisp of smoke was seen to drift
from behind a fir tree at the edge of the clearing.
Without comment, both men broke into a run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aroused by the crashing footsteps, a young
man, who had been lying stretched lazily on the
soft moss, came quickly to his feet, a cigarette
held in his fingers. His companion, also smoking,
lay with his back against the bole of a tree a few
feet distant. Fishing-rods, creeks, landing-nets
and the remains of a lunch lay scattered on the
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know better than to smoke here?”
blazed Wilkinson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fisherman brazenly replaced the cigarette
between his lips. Wilkinson’s arm shot forward
like a flash to pluck the offending weed from
the mouth of the astonished youth. “I wish
we had a law to prevent smoking in the woods.
I would take great pleasure in arresting you,”
he growled savagely as he pinched the fire from
the cigarette and ground it under his heel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unnoticed by the Forest Ranger, the second
man removed his cigarette furtively and with a
flirt of his hand threw it behind him as he rose
to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too damned officious! You have no
authority to prevent us smoking,” he said angrily,
as with clenched fists he advanced belligerently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilkinson was near the breaking point. The
weeks of worry, the long hours of arduous toil,
and the lack of sleep had frayed his nerves.
“Damn you!” he flared, “if it’s a fight you
want——” He broke off suddenly, his eyes
wide and staring. “My God! look!” he
shouted. A flare of flame shot from the spot
where the cigarette had fallen. A breeze rustled
through the trees to fan the flame to a drumming
roar as a pile of slash caught fire. The Red
Terror was loosed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The alarm!” cried Wilkinson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire!” shouted Donald as he stumbled to
the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire!” repeated the nearest patrolman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire!” rang the cry down the line until the
call reached the mill, and every whistle was
loosed in a screaming bedlam of sound to blanch
the cheeks of these hardy men, who knew the
awful terror of this devastating, devouring, fiery
scourge that blasts the wilderness with smoke
and ashes and takes its toll of both man and
beast. Men dropped their tools and ran to
answer the call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trapper’s dugout shot swiftly across the
lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie lay reading in the shade of her cabin.
She came to her feet at the whistle’s first call
for help. A moment later, seated astride her
cayuse, she was galloping down the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every man, regardless of position, answers the
call to fight fire. When a forest fire is raging
the forest ranger is an absolute sovereign. He
can call the lawyer from his desk or the labourer
from the ditch, but seldom does he need to
exercise this power, as every good citizen is
willing to help stay the deadly scourge. Meanwhile
the fire was leaping from heap to heap of
the powder-like slash to cross the road and
sweep up the hill with incredible speed. With
a throbbing roar it hissed to the tree-tops and
rushed up the mountain. Stifling smoke enveloped
the fire-fighters. Showers of burning
bark pelted them from above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the mill!” Wilkinson shouted; “we can
do nothing here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men at the mill filed silently to their
stations, and the big hoses poured torrents of
water on roof and wall. Big jets curved up the
hill to drench the dry, hot earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In short, quick sentences Wilkinson outlined
his plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will try to stop it on the north at the
river, on the south with fire-breaks, and at the
track on the east by back-firing. On the west
we have to let the fire take its course until it
burns itself out on the cliff above.” His voice
rose in sharp command as he sent the men to
their posts. Donald with twenty men under
him was set to work digging a fire-break on the
south side. A “fire-break” is made by spading
up the leaf-mould and humus down to the
mineral soil and raking all inflammable material
back from each side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire was advancing rapidly and the heat
was terrific. Choking and gasping in the stinging
resinous smoke, the men strove in frenzy of
haste to complete the fire-break before the flames
should reach them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A deer with a fawn at her heels came bounding
in terror through the screen of smoke. Grouse
and song-birds made a common escape from a
common enemy feared by all. Rabbits, wild-eyed,
scuttled in fear; squirrels and chipmunks
joined in the hurried flight. Many of these
smaller birds and animals would be flanked and
lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie, proud that she could be of assistance,
dashed back and forth carrying messages for
Wilkinson to the different fronts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From up the mountain-side came a drumming
roar and the rending crash of trees as the fire
undermined their roots. Sparks from burning
tree-tops crossed the fire-break and started other
fires. To combat these, water had to be carried
up the steep hillside in pails. Andy was among
those delegated to this arduous task. For hours
he staggered from stream to hill and back again
with a brimming pail in either hand. Scorched
by sun and fire, the perspiration streaming down
his face and stinging his eyes, the little hero
stuck gamely to his task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ’ired on this ’ere job as a cook,” he grumbled,
“not as a blinkin’ water-spout. Strike
me pink, if the water I’ve carried to-day was
sprinkled in ’ell the devil’d be out of a job. Oh,
well,” he added resignedly as he filled his pails
and turned to again ascend the hill, “as Methusalem
said, ‘Every little bit ’elps!’ These two
buckets myke exactly four million, two ’undred
and six gallons that I’ve carried this d’y.” At
this instant his foot caught in a root to send him
sprawling on his face rolling down the mossy
hillside, the pails clattering after. He lay where
he had fallen, flat on his back, with arms outstretched.
“There,” he soliloquized, “<span class='it'>that</span> was
the wisp of straw that broke the elephant’s back.
To ’ell with the fire. Let the blighter burn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilkinson came wearily down the hill. His
face was blackened and blistered, his hat gone,
and his shirt a network from holes burned
through the cloth by flying sparks. He sprawled
on all fours by the stream, drank sparingly, then
plunged his face in the cooling waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Ello, Wilkie!” shouted Andy, “ ’ow would
you like to ’ave a cold bottle of beer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilkinson seized a stone threateningly and
glared at his tormentor. “Men have been
killed for less,” he growled huskily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I s’y, Wilkie,” grinned Andy, “these Forestry
jobs are a snap. Do you ’ave the nerve to
collect a salary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The district ranger was too tired for speech.
His swollen face puckered in a smile and he
passed on up the hill, and Andy came stiffly to
his feet and resumed his never-ending task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie brought reports that the fire was
being held on the north and east. The fire-break
on the south held, but spot-fires were kept
in check only by the almost superhuman efforts
of the fire-fighters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forest fires reach the peak of their intensity
while the sun is hottest. With darkness the
wind subsides, and, especially in the mountains
the heavy dews are a never-failing help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun, showing blood-red through the
smoke, now sank behind the hills and a blessed
coolness filled the air. The fire smouldered
along the fire-breaks, but the dreaded sparks
were not flying. The trembling roar diminished
to a steady crackling where fallen trees were
being steadily consumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire-fighters, their shoulders drooping,
and wavering from sheer weakness, plodded
down the hill for well-earned food and rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to be at it again at daylight,”
said Wilkinson grimly. They nodded a tired
assent. Wilkinson and Donald with twelve men
patrolled the fire area throughout the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning broke sullenly in a dull
haze. As the first streaks of light heralded the
coming of the new day, the fire-fighters again
took up their posts. Men from the other mill
arrived, and another day of battle with the fire
demon was begun. An attempt was made to
check it on the west front, high up the mountain-side,
where the fire had crept through in the
night to a small level plateau. At ten o’clock
the wind came suddenly, and with it the fire
broke through on the south-west corner with a
deafening roar and rushed through a stand of
dead trees with ever-increasing speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald shouted a quick cry of warning to the
men who were in danger of being cut off by
this break. They came on the double quick,
just in time, as a lurid wall of flame shot up the
hill over the path they had traversed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are the men all out?” questioned Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Andy isn’t here!” said one of the men
excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald seized the speaker’s arm. “Was
Andy with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s face set in grim lines. Whirling
quickly, he ran straight toward the line of fire.
With a bound Connie was on her horse and after
him at a swift trot. As he neared the screen of
smoke, Pegasus changed his gait to that of a
mad runaway, and with the small rider lying
prone on his bare back disappeared from view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this spot the fire had spent its fury in the
first mad rush, but a heavy smoke welled up
from the charred ground. Terror possessed the
horse, but the calm voice of his mistress urged
him on. Crimson embers showered about her.
Scorching heat fanned her face as if the doors
of a blast furnace had been opened. A blazing
branch fell with a rushing sound, barely missing
the horse’s head. Sharp reports from the tree-tops
made the plucky cayuse shy in a panic of
fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Filled with apprehension, the crowd of fire-fighters
stared with tense anxiety into the drifting
smoke. Then a glad cheer burst from them as
horse and rider emerged: Andy clinging to
Connie’s stirrup, and Donald swaying drunkenly
in the rear. Ready hands held water to Andy’s
parched lips and bathed his hot face as he lay
panting on the ground. He sat up with an
effort and looked about him. “Where’s Connie?”
he asked. But Connie had stolen quietly from
the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By mid-afternoon the main body of the fire
was apparently under control, but the persistent
spot-fires kept the entire crew engaged. A huge
cottonwood, standing just within the fire-breaks,
was the chief offender. Sparks from its lofty
blazing top were floated by the breeze to land
on the dry ground, starting innumerable fires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That tree will have to come down or we
will be fighting spot-fires indefinitely,” said
Wilkinson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence fell. Everyone of those lumber-jacks
knew the danger attached to the falling of a
rotten, blazing tree. In sound timber the skilled
“faller” can cut the scarf and drive the falling-wedge
to lay the tree within six inches of the
desired spot. With a hollow tree the task is
much more difficult, as in the soft, decayed pulp
the wedge may not provide sufficient leverage to
swing the enormous weight, and the tree may
crash from any angle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men working at the butt of a burning tree,
too, are exposed to the fall of branches. Even
a small bough, hurtling from the dizzy height of
lordly cottonwood or fir, will break a man’s limbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilkinson picked up a falling saw. “Who
will go with me?” he called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis stepped forward with wedge and
hammer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothin’ doin’,” said little Blackie; “Wilkinson
here has a wife and kid, an’ Jack has
brains enough to be our boss. Me and Hoop-la
ain’t got neither, we’re just a coupla roughnecks.
Whadda you say, Hoop-la?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye betcha,” came vigorously from Blackie’s
pal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two men were sent with them to assist in
clearing a space at the foot of the big snag. A
few minutes later the twang of the cross-cut,
mingled with Blackie’s happy song, sounded
above the crackling of the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilkinson pointed to the southern sky, where
heavy nimbus clouds were massing. “At last!
The blessed rain is coming!” he cried in a
voice of thankfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stronger gust swept through the valley
to send a surge of flame from the giant cottonwood’s
topmost branches. There was a sharp
cry of warning as a limb broke off with a splinter-crash
and came roaring to the ground, sending
up a swirl of dust. A strangled cry of pain,
animal-like in its intensity, cut the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blackie’s hit,” screamed Hoop-la.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackie lay on his face, his clothing afire,
pinned down by the shattered limb. With a
heave of powerful shoulders Hoop-la flung the
crushing weight aside, and his big hands quickly
smothered the fire in the clothing of his fallen
comrade. Gently he raised the stricken man
in his arms and bore him beyond the range of
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blackie! Oh, Blackie! are you all right?”
he questioned fearfully as he looked down at the
quiet face that held the grey pallor of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call the doctor and bring a stretcher,”
sharply ordered Wilkinson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men hurried to do his bidding. When the
stretcher bearers leaned to lift the inanimate
body, Hoop-la fiercely interfered. “Let him
alone,” he said savagely. Stooping, he picked
up the light form and bore it down the hill to
their bed in the rough log shack. Donald
forced a few drops of brandy through the dying
man’s colourless lips. Blackie stirred feebly.
His eyes flickered open and he smiled as he
recognized Hoop-la.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me your hand,” he whispered faintly;
“I’m runnin’ my last high-lead, old pal. I
guess God’ll be good to us roughnecks.” He
gasped painfully. The irregular breathing
ceased; his eyes became fixed and glassy; his
jaw sagged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hoop-la sat motionless, the hand of his dead
friend held in his warm clasp. Slowly his head
dropped forward and his big frame shook with
dry racking sobs. Doctor Paul came in hurriedly.
In answer to the look of interrogation
in Donald’s eyes, he shook his head sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald and Wilkinson tiptoed softly to the
door. They were unashamed of the tears that
made furrows down their blackened cheeks.
Sick at heart, utterly overcome by this tragedy,
Wilkinson sank dejectedly to a seat outside
the cabin door and covered his face with his
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a sudden patter of raindrops that
drummed on the roof of the cabin. Wilkinson
stood erect with arms stretched wide. “Rain!”
he cried. “The merciful rain! Thank
heaven!” He stood with face upturned for an
interval, enjoying the pelting downpour, then
turned to look in the cabin door, a deep and
brooding sadness in his bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donald,” he said gently, “the newspaper
account of this fire will mention the fact that ‘a
logger was killed.’ A logger!—yes—men like
Blackie are the backbone of this country, the
salt of the earth. Will people ever learn?”
he continued, in a voice vibrant with deep
emotion. He pointed to the barkless skeletons
of trees blackened and charred and branchless
save for the gibbet-like limbs stuck out from the
naked trunks. “Think of it! All this—the
sniffing out of a valuable life—a verdant hillside
changed to a charnel-house of dead trees and
blackened stumps on bare rocks—the loss of
thousands of dollars worth of valuable timber—all
this caused by the careless dropping of a
lighted cigarette!”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>Donald’s</span> announcement that Labour Day
would be celebrated at the Lake was received with
good-natured approval by the men of the camp,
who spoke of the coming event as the “dry”
holiday. The rain, which had brought such
blessed relief to the hearts of the guardians of the
forest, had cleansed the air of the last vestige
of haze that had overhung the valley for the past
month.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning of the holiday dawned auspiciously.
The hot days of August had given
place to the mellow sunshine of Indian summer.
Through the crystal clear atmosphere the mountains
seemed much nearer, standing out sharply
against the blue sky. Near the top there had
been a fresh fall of snow that had covered the
bare ice of the glaciers like a white mantle.
The brilliant rays of the September sun were
reflected from this virgin covering with a brilliancy
that was dazzling to the eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet arrived for the occasion, bringing with
her a score of her friends. All through the
previous day the trail from the north had brought
strings of cayuses from the Indian Reserve,
their dusky riders gaily bedecked in holiday attire.
“<span class='it'>Klahowya, tillicum!</span>” they shouted, their coffee-coloured
faces lighting up with a grin that
betokened a gala day spirit. Their tents dotted
the lake-shore, their camp fires glowing cheerfully
throughout the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sports committee had arranged a varied list
of events. A rowing race between the two camps;
a sack race, free for all; a baseball game between
the whites and the Indians; a sawing race in
which two “buckers” from each camp would
participate; a hundred-yard dash; a log-rolling
contest between a man from the State of Maine
and a citizen of New Brunswick. But these were
mere preliminaries to the real event of the day,
the much advertised horse-race. The men from
the other camps, arrayed in their “Sunday
clothes” made their appearance early in the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each camp brought its quota of sandwiches and
cakes, but the brunt of the work fell on Andy and
his assistants, who piled tier upon tier of sandwiches
on the long tables under the willows by the
lake-shore. The lemonade was in half-barrels
at each end of the tables, with a “help yourself”
sign attached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Klootchmen, with stolid, sombre faces,
etched deep with cross-hatching of wrinkles,
walked through the throng laden with baskets
they were trying to sell. “Mika tika basket,”
quavered their aged voices as they held forth
their wares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About eleven o’clock Mr. Wainwright appeared
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Connie?” asked Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you are aware, Mr. McLean, Connie is
very shy. I could not induce her to accompany
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will never do,” said Donald quickly.
“I am going after her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid that your trip will avail you
nothing,” smiled Wainwright in his absent-minded
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald borrowed a cayuse and set off up the
trail. He hitched the horse at the edge of the
clearing and proceeded on foot down the path, his
shoes making no sound on the soft dark earth.
As he turned a clump of alders and came in view
of the cabin he stopped short, arrested by a sight
that evidently elicited his amused interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie stood outside the door before a small
mirror hung on the rough log walls of the house.
She was attempting to place her heavy hair in a
knob at the top of her head. A page cut from
a magazine was tacked to a log near the mirror.
She studied the photograph carefully, then
returned to the attack with renewed vigour. But
she could not get it to suit her. She tried and
tried, but the heavy shining coils would elude
her slender fingers and fall in a golden cascade
over her slight shoulders. Her efforts to reach a
satisfactory result brought her to the verge of
tears. She stamped her little foot impetuously.
At last she got it arranged in a fair semblance to
that of the envied actress. The effect was so
startling that Donald fairly gasped. The child
of the moment before was transformed, as if by a
fairy’s wand, to a woman of wondrous grace
and beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie perked her head saucily, then half
smiled to show her small milk-white teeth;
apparently she was pleased with the reflection
she saw in the glass. From the clothes-line
she took a flour sack that had been split open and
washed to be used for drying dishes. Draping
this from her waist-line, she pinned it securely.
Assuming a haughty pose, she walked past the
mirror with a sinuous, undulating movement.
The little artist was so perfect in her mimicry
that Donald’s lips involuntarily formed the word
“Janet.” Twice she passed before the tiny
mirror with a regal step, her head turning with
its characteristic bird-like motion to catch the
reflection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually the queenly pose slipped from her.
She stopped abruptly, throwing out her arms
with a forlorn gesture. Her golden head fell
forward. Two big tears welled from her blue
eyes and ran down the small freckled nose.
Her small hands plucked convulsively at her
faded blue overalls. A sob like a stab [of] pain
shook her slender body. One arm came up
slowly to cover her tear-wet face as she threw
herself face forward on the grass. Her slender
shoulders were shaking with such an agony of
weeping that Donald’s throat felt constricted
and his eyes grew suddenly dim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her spotted cayuse, grazing nearby, raised
his head at the sound of Connie’s hysterical
sobbing and moved to the small figure of his
mistress. With ears bent forward and a look
of bewilderment in his soft eyes, he nuzzled her
neck with his velvety nose. The sobbing continued,
but her brown hand came up to pat his
head lovingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald tiptoed softly back to the trail. He
stood for some time with his hand on the saddle,
his head bowed in deep thought. “Poor little
kid,” he said gently, then whistling a lively
tune, he slowly retraced his steps to the cabin.
He entered the clearing just in time to see Connie
as she disappeared in the timber across the field.
He did not want her to know that he was aware
of her flight, so he knocked loudly on the door
and shouted her name. A raven croaked
derisively from the top of a dead tree. The
pony raised his head to eye him silently.
Connie’s pet deer came around the corner of the
barn, a look of gentle questioning in her beautiful
big eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald rode slowly back to camp. Connie’s
distress had touched his heart; her heart-breaking
sobs were still ringing in his ears. “It is not
that Wainwright does not love his daughter,”
mused Donald. “It must be that he is very poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t see how I can help,” his thoughts
ran on. “One can’t very well suggest to a
father that he buy clothes for his child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy rang the lunch-bell, and there was a
wild but good-natured scramble for the tables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long table had been arranged in the big
dining-room for the officials and Janet’s party
to which Donald had invited Mr. Wainwright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you find Connie?” queried Wainwright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” lied Donald, “I couldn’t find her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet’s friends were having a merry time.
There was laughter, jesting and gay repartee
from all sides. Douglas was in his element,
his quips and brilliant sallies keeping the diners
in a continual uproar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Donald glanced around the big table at
the laughing faces of the gay party, he tried
to visualize Connie dressed as one of these
fashionably-clad girls who represented Vancouver’s
“younger set.” The vision he conjured
caused him to smile dreamily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet had manœuvred to secure a seat beside
Donald. In spite of all her artful contriving,
she had been unable to have more than a few
words with her father’s busy general superintendent
since her arrival. She noticed the
dreamy smile on his face and wondered what
could be the cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem rather distraught,” she said with
an arch smile, her dark eyes fixed on his face.
“Aren’t you enjoying yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes,” he replied absently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were gone for some time this morning,”
she stated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he concurred, “I went up to bring
Connie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet’s fine eyebrows lifted slightly, and she
looked at Donald with a curious intentness.
“Why didn’t she come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She wasn’t home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her woman’s intuition long ago had told her
that the “wood-sprite”—as Donald called Connie—was
madly in love with him. As she looked
at him now and noticed his pre-occupied air,
a pang of jealousy shot through her heart like an
arrow. Was it possible that he had begun to
realise that the wild girl of the woods was not a
child, and that a love for her had been kindled
in his heart? The thought made her feel faint
and she tried to put it from her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lunch was finished now and they were walking
back to the lake. Douglas invited the party
to take a trip around the lake in a motor-boat,
to which they assented gleefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet hesitated as Donald turned away with
Wainwright. “Aren’t you coming, Mr. McLean?”
she called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald turned and shook his head. “I may
be needed here,” he said briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet flushed to the roots of her dark hair and
bit her lip in anger. She was not used to being
thwarted in her desires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald and Wainwright seated themselves
on a bench under the willows and lighted cigarettes.
Donald was ill at ease. The sound of
Connie’s tragic sobbing was ringing in his ears.
He could see her little figure writhing on the
ground in a tempest of grief that had torn at his
heart-strings. He sprang involuntarily to his
feet and began pacing the ground with quick,
nervous strides. Wainwright glanced up at
him interrogatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem worried,” he volunteered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am,” Donald admitted briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I assist you in any way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald was in a welter of indecision. How
should he broach this delicate subject? Although
poor as the proverbial church-mouse, Connie’s
father had the pride of Lucifer. There was
natural dignity in his bearing, a certain aloofness
in his manner, that in no way interfered
with his unfailing courtesy, but had always
precluded exchange of intimacies. He had
resided in this wilderness for many years, but
none could say that they had any more knowledge
of his affairs at this moment than on the day
of his arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald decided to take the plunge. He sat
down on the bench beside Connie’s father and
related the scene he had witnessed that morning—of
Connie’s preening before the mirror with the
magazine page pinned to the logs; of the struggle
with her hair; of the flour sack, and of the
piteous sobbing of the heart-broken child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright’s face flushed painfully. There
was a look of poignant suffering in his grave eyes.
Of all the races in the world, the English—especially
of the better class—fight most stoically
to hide their distress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright leaned forward, his throat working
convulsively as he struggled to regain composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you do not consider me presumptuous,”
said Donald, a note of anxiety in his tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright’s hand reached forth to clasp
Donald’s firmly. “No, I do not doubt your
sincerity. An inordinate sense of pride has
kept me in my present circumstances. This
circumstance you have related has brought me to
a realization that it is a selfish pride, as it has
denied Connie the privileges to which she is
entitled. There is nothing I can say,” he went
on in bitter self-condemnation, “that can even
partially condone or palliate my stupidity. I
should have known that she would require
proper clothing now that she is grown up. As
a matter of fact”—he paused, his distress acute—“my
finances are at a very low ebb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old is Connie?” asked Donald, hoping
to relieve Wainwright’s embarrassment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nineteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s head came up with a jerk. “What!”
he almost shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is nineteen,” Wainwright reiterated,
a peculiar expression in his eyes as he noticed
Donald’s bewilderment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nineteen!” Donald re-echoed, a bemused
look on his face. “Great Scot! This is a
surprise. I thought of Connie as being not
more than fourteen or fifteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Connie’s healthful outdoor life has tended
to keep her young, and her mode of dressing
enchances the youthful effect,” said her father
as he sat down wearily, a far-away look in his
eyes. “Her mother,” he went on softly, a tremor
in his voice, “was just like her; at the age of
twenty-five she looked almost a child.” He
turned to Donald. “No doubt you have
wondered why I buried myself in this wilderness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald nodded. At this moment they were
interrupted by members of the Sports Committee,
who wanted Donald’s advice on a matter
pertaining to the afternoon’s programme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was evident to Donald as he withdrew that
Wainwright had been about to disclose his past
history, a history which had been locked in his
heart these many years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At three o’clock the crowd began drifting
toward the race-course. The centre of the
valley had been cleared of under-brush, and the
long grass burned under the watchful eye of
the fire-ranger. A small creek and a few
swampy places had been “corduroyed” with
cedar poles and then covered with soil. A
judges’ stand, with a few hastily erected seats
for Janet’s party, stood near the finishing point.
The horse-race, as has been said, was to be the
feature event of the day. The crowd surged
happily from the lake-shore to line up in orderly
ranks about the oval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brilliant and diversified colours of the
Klootchmen’s skirts and head-gear showed in
bright contrast to the drab wearing apparel
of the white men. The Siwash Indians were
dressed in nondescript clothing as to trousers
and coat, but one and all wore side-brimmed
cowboy hats and displayed silk handkerchiefs of
gorgeous hues, knotted at the throat to drape
their shoulders carelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three husky farmers’ sons from Pemberton
rode to the starting-line amid hearty hand-clapping
and shouting from their friends. A
swarthy-skinned rider, mounted on a spirited
black cayuse, came prancing through the crowd.
He lifted his hat and smiled in acknowledgment
of the plaudits of the spectators. This was
Joe Lafonte, the half-breed who had won first
prize at the Lillooet races for the past two seasons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wise ones averred that Paul John, of the
Indian contingent, would give him a hard race.
Paul John’s cayuse was young, but the previous
year he had run the half-breed’s horse a close
second. Money was being placed on all sides,
particularly by the Indians, who are inveterate
gamblers. Amid an excited babble in Chinook,
nine Indian riders came laughing and shouting,
with much waving of hats, to prance about and
display their horsemanship before the admiring
crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald, with Andy, Gillis and Wainwright,
stood leaning over the edge of the judges’ stand
watching the animated scene below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment there was an agitation at the
far end of the oval, where the crowd opened to
admit a horse and rider that came tearing down
the course like the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!” Donald shouted excitedly as he
seized Wainwright’s arm. “It’s Connie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the course, riding like a spirit of the
woods, came the girl, her golden hair blowing about
her face, sitting astride her mettlesome horse and
riding as if the wilderness belonged to her alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegasus was not used to crowds. With
arched neck and quivering flanks he reared on
his hindlegs to poise an instant, then leaped
forward like a rabbit. Connie sat on the bare
back of her adored cayuse as though a part of
the animal, her slender body moving in gentle
undulations in perfect co-ordination with the
movements of the horse. She was hard set
to keep from running over the other riders,
who sat with mouths agape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie was unknown to the greater part of the
crowd. To them this child-like equestrienne,
with her mass of shining hair, appeared as an
apparition. Her firm little hands soon checked
her turbulent mount, who stood trembling with
nervousness. The crowd gave her a rousing
welcome as soon as they had recovered from
their astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is she? Where does she come from?”
they shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie kept her eyes fixed on the ground.
She was outwardly calm and serene; inwardly
she was as nervous as her fretting cayuse, and
did not dare raise her flushed face to meet the
battery of eyes around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald turned to Wainwright. “Are you
going to let her run? Is it safe for her to enter
a race with all those men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t stop her now, and besides,” he
added with a touch of pride, “she can hold
her own with any of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old trapper made his way to Donald’s
side. His leathery old face, with its multitudinous
wrinkles, wore a perturbed expression.
“That feller Lafonte is cultus. He’s full of
dirty tricks; ’tain’t safe for Connie to ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald turned anxiously to Wainwright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s father shook his head. “I am afraid
it is too late now.” Then in a lower voice he
added: “You must know the reason for her
entering this race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald looked puzzled for an instant. Suddenly
it dawned on him. “The purse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright nodded. “It would break her
heart if I forbade her to ride, now that she has
gone this far. She must have decided suddenly,
as she never mentioned it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rennie Company had put up a purse of
two hundred and fifty dollars. There was to be a
collection taken after the race to add to this purse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horses trotted down the course. Connie’s
was rearing and prancing, and it was with difficulty
that she managed to get him to join the
others. She leaned forward to whisper words of
quieting in his twitching ears. Down the course
they came. They were in nice alignment as they
passed the judges’ stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie on her spotted cayuse showed as a
bright splash of colour in the midst of her darker
competitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lafonte’s dark face lighted with a savage gleam
as he swung his horse to the inside or “pole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Running neck and neck with him was his
hated rival, Paul John, leaning low on his horse’s
neck and shouting unintelligibly in Chinook.
Connie was with the stragglers five lengths in
the rear. This was new to Pegasus, and he was
bewildered by the crowding horses about him.
As they turned the corner of the course, Lafonte’s
horse stumbled, and before he righted Paul John
had slipped into the lead. Cursing wildly,
Lafonte settled himself in the saddle, his horse’s
head at the flank of his rival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hundreds of times Pegasus had travelled this
field with Connie clinging to his back, slowing
up for shrubs and trees and making sudden
bursts of speed in the open. That had been
vastly different to being surrounded by running
horses and listening to the wild cries of their
riders and the roaring of the excited crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the moment Lafonte lost the point of vantage
to his rival, Connie leaned forward and
emitted a peculiar clucking sound, at the same
time striking her moccasined feet into the
horse’s sides. Pegasus’s ears twitched back at
the sound of the voice he loved. “Now I know
what you want,” he seemed to say, as his beautiful
neck stretched out and his hoofs spurned the
ground. His graceful body lowered until it
appeared to the spectators as though he were just
skimming the earth. He moved with a springy
stride, the muscles of his sinewy frame working
with a sliding movement beneath the glossy skin.
Gradually he drew away from the horses travelling
with him. Foot by foot he crawled up on
the leaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party in the judges’ stand came to their
feet to shout approval. The girls were cheering
wildly for Connie as she crept nearer the front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald was leaning forward with flushed face,
his eyes glued to the spotted cayuse, a deep
admiration in his heart for the intrepid little rider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Andy jumped on the rail. “Strike me
pink!” he yelled, “look at that ’oss run!” His eyes
were bright with excitement. “A ’undred dollars
on the spotted ’oss!” he shouted hysterically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take you,” said a voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Ere you are, mate; let’s make ’er two
’undred. I’m for me ’ome girl. She saved me
blinkin’ life, God bless ’er!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they neared one of the corduroy bridges
Connie was neck and neck with Lafonte. The
latter glanced up as Pegasus came opposite. The
roar of the crowd came dimly to Connie’s ears
above the swish of air and the rumble of hoofs
as they struck the culvert. An evil look crossed
the half-breed’s face. He swung his horse
sharply to the right. Connie’s horse floundered.
Struggling to right himself, he fell off the bridge
and landed with a dull thud on the soft ground
below. The forward motion of the cayuse had
stopped so suddenly that Connie was thrown
like a projectile to a clump of bushes fifteen feet
distant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant the big crowd was paralyzed.
Then there went up a great groan of horror.
The old trapper came to his feet, his eyes flaming,
a hectic flush on his cheeks. Like a flash his
hand flew to his six-shooter, and the long-barrelled
Colts was trained on Lafonte. As he
pulled the trigger Douglas struck his arm and the
bullet sped harmlessly over the horseman’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words whistled through the set teeth of
big Jack Gillis. “Let me get at him!” he cried
hoarsely, as, pale of face, he struggled through
the crowd. He would have thrown himself in
front of the oncoming rider if strong hands had
not clutched and held him. Connie’s father fell
back a step as if struck a sudden blow, his eyes
wide and staring. Andy’s head fell forward,
and he groaned aloud. Janet covered her face
with her hands and sat down weakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald leaned from the judges’ stand, his face
pale as death. A vision of Connie’s broken body
came before his eyes. “Oh, God!” he cried
aloud in a voice vibrant with pain. He covered
his eyes as though in dread of looking at the
spot where she had fallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shout came from the crowd—then a cheer
that seemed to rock the hills. “Look! look!”
they shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s heart was beating tumultuously.
Could he believe his eyes? Connie was standing
upright. She appeared to sway slightly; then,
like a flash, she was at her horse’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trembling and snorting, Pegasus came to his
feet. With a bound she was on his back and
seized the reins. Pegasus reared like a stag and
was off down the course at the tail end of the
race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Connie passed the judges’ stand she was
well up with the tail-riders and gaining steadily.
Her face was pale and tense. A smear of red
showed on her arm, and a little stream of blood
trickled down her forehead from the wound
invisible in the thickness of her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd became suddenly quiet as Connie
thundered past—a silent tribute to her glorious
pluck. But as she crept toward her original
position they roared their applause. Pegasus
was showing an endurance and speed that had
never been equalled in all of that district. As
they turned to come down the home-stretch
Connie was a good fifty yards behind the leaders.
Lafonte’s wiry cayuse was again in the lead by
a few feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shock and strain were beginning to tell
on Connie. She leaned forward and in a broken,
trembling voice she cried: “Oh, Peggy! Win,
Peggy! Please! Please! I don’t want to lose!
I’ve got to win! Go! Go!” She was sobbing
hysterically now, and her small hands were
patting the horse’s neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegasus had never heard that tone of supplication
in the sweet voice of his mistress before.
Nobly he responded to the call. She felt his
body lower under her as he set himself to the
herculean task of overcoming his rival’s enormous
lead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lafonte was using the whip. Paul John,
hanging so persistently to his flank, angered him.
They thundered across the corduroy, and at the
sound of Pegasus’s hoofs on the cedar poles
Lafonte turned to glance behind. A look of
astonishment crossed his face as he saw the
golden-haired rider so close. With a curse he
struck his horse a brutal blow that caused the
animal to lose its stride momentarily and fall
back in line with Paul John.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly, but surely, Connie’s spotted cayuse
was closing the gap between himself and the two
leaders, sweeping along at a terrific pace, his
body and limbs moving with the rhythmic grace
of a thoroughbred. Connie was leaning so low
that the heavy white mane of her horse was
brushing her face. Her hair was streaming in
the wind like fine-spun gold. The party in the
judges’ stand rushed to the railing, leaned
anxiously forward to get a glimpse of the running
horses as they turned the corner, and
cheered lustily as the three riders thundered over
the small bridge and came toward the finishing
line. Connie was at Lafonte’s flank now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegasus’s remarkable speed fanned the spectators’
excitement to a fever heat. Andy had
done so much shouting that his voice was
reduced to a whisper. Standing on the top rail,
his arms waving, he was shouting huskily, “Come
on, Connie! Come on, Connie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s dark eyes were glowing as he watched
the slender figure clinging to the flying horse’s
bare back. “What a pity if she loses,” he said
under his breath. Leaping to the rail, he joined
in the shouts of encouragement to the straining
Pegasus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With one hundred yards to go, Connie uttered
one last appeal to her flying steed. Above the
drumming of hoofs the spectators heard her
voice ring in passionate entreaty. “Now, Peg!
Now! Go! Go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With nostrils distended, his breath coming in
choking gasps, his eyes bulging, and the voice of
his adored mistress ringing in his ears, the
gallant animal with a burst of speed that made
the onlookers marvel, ranged himself alongside
his labouring rivals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten yards from the finish—five yards—they
were neck and neck. Then, summoning his
last ounce of strength, Pegasus leaped forward
as though he would annihilate time and distance.
With eyes nearly blinded with dirt, tears and
the roaring air, Connie saw Pegasus hurl himself
past the winning post—a winner by half a length!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ear-splitting roar that went up from the
race-mad crowd must have caused the marmots
on the slides near the distant glaciers to seek
their holes in terror. A flock of mallard ducks,
which had floated peacefully near the centre of
the placid lake throughout the day’s commotion,
rose with frightened cries to seek a more secluded
spot in which to finish their afternoon’s siesta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd had seemingly gone mad. The
atmosphere pulsated with a wild tumult of sound.
Hats were thrown in air and throats were
strained with shouting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald found himself with his arms about
Andy, dancing and cheering in a frenzy of joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie made no attempt to check her cayuse’s
onward flight. She was in no mood to listen to
the kudos of the admiring crowd; she wanted
only to get away from the scene as quickly as
possible. The movement toward the centre
gave her the opportunity she desired, and she
urged the weary cayuse through an opening on
her left. Many hands were reached up to
congratulate her, but she pushed her way through
to the trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sound of hoof-beats behind her she
turned to see Lafonte urging his tired mount
toward the Pemberton trail and looking back
apprehensively over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several men were running after him, shaking
their fists and uttering loud imprecations. A
man leaped from behind a jack-pine to land in
the path in front of the half-breed, lunged for
the reins, missed, then caught the stirrup.
Lafonte struck the man a blow with his heavy
whip that loosened his hold and felled him to the
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie saw Gillis break from the crowd, jump
to the saddle of a cayuse and start after the
fleeing man just as the latter disappeared in the
woods. Gillis waved his hand to her and vanished
in pursuit. She urged Pegasus to the
shelter of the timber as she saw her father and
Donald running toward her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strenuous race and the spectacular fall
had left both horse and rider in a badly shaken
condition. Connie’s body was bruised and sore,
and her head ached horribly. The cayuse’s
strained muscles were stiffening, he was limping
badly, and his head drooped wearily as he
dragged his tired limbs up the steep trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the barn door Connie dismounted stiffly,
removed the horse’s bridle, then threw her arms
passionately around his neck and stroked his
symmetrical head with soft caresses. “I’m so
sorry, Peggy darling,” she said in a choking voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horse nipped her shoulder in a weak
attempt at playfulness, as if to signify that he
quite understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s eyes brightened at a sudden thought.
“Peggy dear,” she whispered softly as she
nestled her cheek against his soft mane, “do you
know that I can have some nice clothes now?
Lots and lots of nice things. I am going to buy
you a blanket—a nice thick one for winter—and
some ribbons for your mane. And you, Peggy”—with
a flood of tenderness in her voice—“you
won all this for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was crooning sweet nothings in his ear
that only Pegasus could understand when her
father appeared, breathless from running, his
face grey and anxious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you all right, Constance darling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie stepped forward. She was pale and
weak, but her colourless lips tried to form a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Daddy dear—I’m—all—ri——” Her
voice trailed to a whisper and the blue eyes
closed as darkness fell upon her like a cloud.
Swaying uncertainly for an instant, she fell
like a broken flower into her father’s outstretched
arms. For the first time in her life Connie had
fainted. She lay like a child in his trembling
arms, her upturned face wearing the pallor of
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a prayer on his lips and an agony of fear
in his heart, her father carried her to the cabin
and tenderly stretched the bruised little body
on the coarse blankets of her bunk.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>At</span> the race-course the crowd eddied excitedly
about the judges’ stand, or stood in groups
talking of the wonderful performance of the
spotted cayuse that had made the erstwhile
champion appear a mere tyro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis came riding slowly from the woods and
was hailed by questioning shouts from a score
of throats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you get him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bloody handkerchief was wrapped around
the big man’s hand, and a livid welt showed on
his forehead. He smiled grimly as he dismounted,
“I got the d——d skunk,” he answered savagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to a group of Indians. “You
fellers’d better look out for him when you go
along; his eyesight’s kinda bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald came to the front of the judges’ stand
and held up his hand for silence. Gradually
the hum of voices died away and the crowd turned
to face him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you know, we are to take up a collection
to add to the Company’s purse. The gentleman
below,” pointing down at Andy, “will hold the
hat. We have witnessed an exhibition of matchless
skill and pluck. Give as you feel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd cheered lustily. Then, jostling
each other good-naturedly like a lot of school-boys,
they formed in a long queue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy started the contribution by giving his
whole roll of bills. Money showered upon him
until he was forced to call for another hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fightin’ ” Jack came to Donald in great
perturbation. “Say! Our gang’s all stony
broke. Can we sign a due-bill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald called the time-keeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make her out for twenty bucks for each of
us,” said “Fightin’ ” Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s spirits soared as the pile rose higher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless ’er little ’eart,” he murmured,
“she can ’ave an ’ole shipload of them blinkin’
camisole things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later, as Donald climbed the hill to
deliver the prize, he met Doctor Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is she, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s had a nasty shaking up, but there are no
bones broken. She will have to remain in bed
for a week or so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright saw Donald coming and stepped
outside the door to meet him. “She’s sleeping,”
he said in a low tone. He looked questioningly
at Donald as the latter passed him the package
of money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The prize money,” Donald explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright peeped at the contents and his
face lit up with pleased astonishment. “I
understood that the purse was to be a small
one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Donald told him of the collection,
Wainwright’s face flushed hotly. “Is that the
custom?” he questioned sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright paced nervously with hands
clasped behind his back. “Pardon my abrupt
manner,” he said contritely, “I am a bit out of
sorts to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every evening Donald called at the Wainwright
home, bringing little delicacies carefully prepared
by Andy. Once he spoke to Connie from
outside the door, and her answering voice gave
him an odd thrill. He pondered over this as
he made his way down the hill. He was struck
by a sudden thought. His face broke into a
smile and he shrugged his shoulders. “Nonsense,”
he said aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet remained several days after her friends
had returned to the city. She had tried in vain
to restore the familiar relations which formerly
existed between herself and Donald. His
evening visits to the cabin on the mountain
deprived her of his company, and she, half-jestingly,
reproved him for his inattention to her.
With spirits depressed and a despondent look
in her dark eyes, Janet returned to Vancouver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening Wainwright gave Donald a letter
to post, addressed to a big departmental store
in Vancouver. A few days later there arrived
numerous bundles and boxes, including a big
trunk. Donald with the assistance of Gillis’s
crew carried them up the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve brought your big trunk with the
‘bulgy top,’ Miss Wainwright,” he called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie sat up in her bunk so quickly that
her head bumped the boards above. “Miss
Wainwright” he had called her! Her eyes
glowed in the dusky half-light. “Thank you
so much,” she replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Wainwright informed Donald
that Connie was up and would see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute, Dad,” she cried as she
heard them approaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feverishly she rushed to the small mirror to
glance at her reflection. With nervous hands
she fluffed the hair about her ears and smoothed
imaginary wrinkles from the collar of her dress.
Then she sat down gravely and arranged her
skirts about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in,” she called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald followed Wainwright, his heart-beats
peculiarly accelerated. For an instant he could
not distinguish objects in the dim interior.
Then his eyes rested on Connie, sitting demurely
in the corner. She wore a gingham dress of
blue, with white collar and cuffs. A dark belt
was fastened snugly at her slender waist. Tiny
high-heeled shoes peeped from below the hem
of her skirt. Her beautiful hair hung down her
back in a huge braid that fastened at the nape
of her slim, round neck with a narrow black bow.
She rose and crossed the room to meet him,
her high heels making her lithe little body
appear much taller. There was something
fragile about her beauty, some of the colour gone
from her cheeks, and just a hint of shadows
under her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald held out his hand. “Good evening,
I’m glad to see that you are better,” he said
awkwardly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slender, warm hand crept timidly into his,
and his fingers closed on it gently as on a flower.
He stared down at her, thrilled by her loveliness.
She raised her eyes with their bewilderingly long
lashes slowly to his face. With a sudden leaping
of his heart, Donald realized that he was in love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked desultorily while Connie sat
timidly on the edge of the uncomfortable chair.
She could not feel at ease in the high, narrow
shoes and the enveloping skirts. And as she
essayed to cross the rough floor with an assumed
air of ease, her ankle turned and she would have
fallen had not Donald caught her in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he raised her to her feet she blushed
furiously, and he fancied he could feel the warm
beating of her heart. With an embarrassed
apology, she slipped from him, crossed to the
table and lighted a candle. And presently
he took his leave, Wainwright walking with him
down the darkening trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright was in one of his brooding moods.
For a few minutes he was silent. As they
neared the bluff he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After witnessing my daughter’s distress the
morning of the race I am afraid that you feel
harshly toward me for allowing her to be placed
in such a humiliating position. You have been
exceedingly kind to us; therefore, I feel that I
should relate the circumstances which have
placed me in my present position. As I told
you that day, I have allowed my pride to withhold
from my daughter her inherited rights.
I will be as brief as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father, who took great pride in the
family name, planned a political career for me
even from the day of my birth. By natural
taste and temperament I was quite unfitted for
public life. I must have been a great trial to
him, as from early boyhood I evinced a great
love for the study of botany and ornithology.
He would go into a red rage when he found me
in the garden studying flowers under a microscope
or stalking birds in the shrubbery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At college I was not a success, either socially
or in my class. Always of a retiring nature, I
did not enter social life or college sports, and the
course of study set for me by my father bored
me extremely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“During my third year at college I met
Connie’s mother. Until that time no woman
had entered my life, although my father had
hinted his plans for my marriage as soon as I
had finished my course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To me any flower shop, however small,
acted as a magnet. One day I stood gazing in
the window of a tiny florist’s shop on the Strand.
A girl was kneeling among the flowers, and as she
lifted her head our eyes met. She was like a
golden lily. Her hair was like Connie’s hair,
and the blue of her eyes was the blue of the
pansies she held in her hand. And her name
was Constance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused for an instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her father, who had been a rector in a small
parish in the south of England, died just previous
to our meeting, leaving his motherless child
without kith or kin. Lest I weary you I may say
briefly that we were married. My father would
not even grant me an interview, but wrote to me
saying that marrying as I had done had barred
me forever from his door. I did not care. I
was happy—completely, supremely happy. I
sold a small estate bequeathed to me by my
mother, and we set out for British Columbia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” he breathed softly, “that voyage!
We could not afford it, but we travelled first-class—it
was our honeymoon and we were young.
We had never been to sea before, and the novelty
of it all wove a spell about us. As we walked the
deck we talked joyously of our wonderful future
in the mysterious Great West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our first year in Vancouver was one of
blessed content. There is no love that could be
greater than ours. Clerical work was scarce,
so I took any job that offered. I would come
home black with coal-dust or white with lime,
and my wife would cry out merrily as she
threw herself into my arms. We turned our
hardships into jests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A smile of infinite tenderness played about his
eyes as memory recalled the golden days with
the woman he loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next winter I was taken grievously ill.
I lay helplessly on my back while my tender wife
tramped from house to house teaching painting
and music. Day after day through all kinds of
weather she made her daily rounds to keep us
in the bare necessities of life, and pay the doctor’s
bills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright’s voice sank and almost failed him
for a moment. Recovering himself, he resumed
his story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She would come home at night, tired and
worn, to fall asleep in a chair by my bedside,
while I raved in a fever. She went without food
to buy dainties for me. She never lost her
cheery smile—but it killed her! She died giving
birth to—to—Constance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears rose to his eyes, and for a moment he
covered them with his hand. With a great effort
he continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I became embittered, changed completely out
of any semblance to my former self. I cursed
my father. I cursed the world. I would
have welcomed death, but as I looked down at
the tiny mite by my dead wife’s side, I knew that
I must fight to live.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A short time after, I received from my father
a letter in which he asked my forgiveness. I
was unfitted to make my own way in the world,
yet my father had turned me brutally away.
My wife had died from overwork and lack of
food. I wrote to him in a black rage a letter
that must have scorched his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For four years I eked out a miserable existence
in the City. My health broke down again, and
my doctor warned me that I must get to a higher
altitude. I learned of this place, turned everything
into cash, and came here, bringing Connie
with me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My sole income has been derived from
writing articles on Nature for the newspapers and
magazines. Several times my father has advertised
in the newspapers, asking me to return. I
read of his death two weeks ago. For Constance’s
sake, I am going to start for England to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright’s head drooped listlessly as he
concluded his story. All energy, all strength of
bearing, seemed to have gone from him. The
bitter remembrances he had voiced had brought
a look of mental anguish to his face. He stood
staring mutely before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s heart ached for this man, whose
great love for his wife was as passionate at this
moment as when she was living. “How he
loved her!” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Wainwright spoke again his voice was
spiritless. “You are the first person to whom I
have spoken of my past; even Constance does not
know.” As he turned to leave Donald gripped
his hand in silence, but with a pressure eloquent
of heart-felt sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy had noticed Donald’s increasing interest
in Connie and had wisely refrained from accompanying
him on his nightly visits. On this
particular night Donald came into the kitchen
whistling a lively air, his face wreathed in smiles.
He slapped Andy heartily on the back as he
asked him for a lunch. His gaiety was so pronounced
that Andy studied him closely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look ’appy, Donnie,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, Andy; I’m the happiest man in the
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He finished eating, then sat staring dreamily at
the smoke of his cigarette as it circled about his
head. Andy discoursed lightly on various subjects,
but Donald did not seem to hear him. After he
left Andy heard him singing merrily in his cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me pink, but I do ’ope Donnie has
waked up! What a pair, what a pair!” he said
to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning Donald rode north on the gas-car
to the scene of logging operations near the
upper lake. He left orders with the men to
bring Wainwright’s baggage to the station.
What Connie’s absence would mean was brought
forcibly to him as he met the trapper leading
Pegasus and her pet deer down the trail to his
cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two hours later Connie and her father stood
on the station platform. Connie was dressed in
an inexpensive blue suit, and wore a neat blue hat
with a jaunty feather. Her golden hair was
piled high in loops and coils that held a sheen of
brightness like the shine of metal where the sun
touched it. She appeared mystified and confused
as the time for the train to pull out drew
near. Andy, standing by her side, cursed softly
as he saw her looking toward the mill, a look of
poignant disappointment in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donald ’ad to go up the line, Connie; guess
something ’as ’appened,” he mumbled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment Donald was heaping opprobrium
on a recalcitrant gas-car that had died
on his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conductor called “All aboard!” Connie
turned to Andy. “Good-bye, Andy,” she said
sweetly, her eyes swimming with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy took her gloved hand. “Good-bye,
Connie,” he returned, attempting a brave smile.
“When are you coming back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe never.” She choked as she stumbled
up the car steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the train started to move Connie came to
the rear platform. A small, pathetic figure
she seemed to Andy as she strained her eyes
toward the north in a vain hope that she would
see Donald. Andy stood in the centre of the
track waving his hat until the flutter of Connie’s
little handkerchief vanished around a curve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the train roared through the cut, the last
view of her loved valley flashed before her eyes.
Her face strangely white, she clung to the brass
rail and gazed with tearful eyes at the only home
she had ever known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they passed the trapper’s cabin, the noise
of the rushing train sent Pegasus galloping
madly about the pasture. With flying hoofs
that tore up the sod he circled around the field,
then came to the fence and with his beautiful
head held high on the arched neck he looked with
startled eyes at the speeding train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a gesture intensely eloquent, Connie
flung out her arms. “Good-bye, Peggy! Good-bye!”
She found her way to a seat and covered
her face with her hands.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Donald flung himself from the gas-car before
it had ceased moving. “Train gone, Andy?” he
shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stood with arms folded. “Gone?” he
yelled, “of course it’s gone. Why in ’ell
wasn’t you ’ere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to go up the line to look over some logs,
and the car broke down,” replied Donald bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Andy with withering sarcasm,
“the timber couldn’t ’ave waited another day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Andy,” asked Donald excitedly, ignoring the
remark, “did Connie leave you her address?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why the ’ell should she give me ’er address?
’Aven’t you ’er address?” was Andy’s unaccommodating
reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I haven’t, I know that they are going to
England, and that is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald sat down dejectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s face softened. “Do you like Connie?”
he queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like her? I love her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case I don’t see ’ow she didn’t let
you know where to find ’er,” puzzled Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She doesn’t know that I care for her,” said
Donald gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s mouth opened. He seized Donald by
the shoulder. “Do you mean to tell me that
you let that girl get away from you without
letting ’er know that you wanted ’er?” he
demanded incredulously. “Strike me ’andsome,”
blazed Andy, “of all the blinkin’ mutts
in this ’ere world—you—you——” Speech
failed him for a moment. “You let that dear
little girl go away broken-’earted.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Andy,” interrupted Donald eagerly, “do
you think Connie cares for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment, as he looked into his friend’s
face, Andy was tempted to tell him of the scene
after his fight with Hand. But the promise to
Connie sealed his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Ow the ’ell should I know?” he mumbled.
“But,” he added with fine sarcasm, “if bone
was ten cents a cubic foot you’d be a multi-millionaire,
you blinkin’ pie-eyed nincompoop—you—you——”
He clapped a tragic hand
to his brow. “You give me a ’eadache,” and
muttering to himself, he trudged up the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Donald went to Vancouver.
He scanned the registers in hotels, inquired at
docks and depots, but no trace of the Wainwrights
could he find. He walked the streets
with a forlorn hope that he might meet them.
The hearts of many slender golden-haired girls
were set fluttering that day as a tall, handsome
young man subjected them to close scrutiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days later he returned to the lake. That
night he switched off the light and sat by the
open window looking out on a night of stars,
with a new moon making a ghostly light on the
lake. An owl’s mournful hoot was answered by
the uncanny cry of a heron. The faint sighing
sound of streams in distant gorges became a
haunting chorus to this duet. He thought of
Connie’s cabin up the mountain, now cold
and dark. How he would miss her! What an
idiot he had been not to have known long ago
that he loved her. He knew now that he had
loved her from the first. Dear little Connie!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald walked the floor until midnight.
Once in bed, he tossed restlessly until the
early morning, then fell into a fitful sleep in
which he dreamed of a small, winsome face and big
blue eyes surrounded by a wealth of golden hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>September with its days of mellow sunshine
passed. October brought heavy hoar frosts
that covered the earth with a robe of diamonds,
and formed ice in the small pools and marshes.
Winter comes early in the mountains. In
mid-winter the valleys between the peaks of the
Coast Range will have five feet of snow when,
a few hundred feet below, where the warm waters
of the Pacific lap the gentle slopes, the grass
is green and there is none of the chilly whiteness
that mantles the towering hills above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a day in November when the air
held a solemn stillness. The firs and pines
pointed straight to the sky without a quiver in
their branches. The brown earth seemed to
say, “I am ready.” The cry of the loon in it
had a dreary sound, a note which seemed to say
that winter was coming. Squirrels working in
the tops of big pines increased their efforts.
The cones, nipped off by their sharp teeth fell
pattering to the ground, to be garnered by these
busy little workers and secreted in their nests in
hollow trees. The bear of the hillsides ate the
frozen berry or the pulp of rotten log to cleanse
its stomach before starting its long winter
sleep in windfall or cave. Thus does Nature
give to the wild things of the forest an instinct
unknown to man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rush of wings sounded high in air as wild
ducks passed in swift flight on their yearly
pilgrimage to the south. Occasionally a flock
would lower in gradually narrowing circles to
land with a splash in the restful waters of the
lake, then to stretch tired wings, the while
bobbing their heads and quacking contentedly.
Flocks of geese passed in wedge-shaped formation,
their honking coming faintly from a
dizzy height. A flock of Arctic swans, skimming
so low that the crisp rustle of their wings could
be heard, landed in the centre of the lake with a
great commotion. There with their beautiful
necks proudly arched they floated like white
ghosts throughout the night. The red and
yellow leaves, like gaudy curtains draped the
deciduous trees. The wild crab-apple and high-bush
cranberry hung frozen on the naked
branches. The sun was surrounded by a ring
and shone weakly through a misty haze. The
unmistakable breath of the north wind was in
the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old John took his traps down from the loft
and oiled them. A patch was found needed
on a worn moccasin, and new laces were inserted
in his snowshoes. “Winter’s comin’, ol’ timer,
and we’re goin’ to have a heavy fall of snow,”
he mused to himself. For two days Nature gave
warning, then on the second night the storm came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A roaring wind came bellowing from the
north, lashing the waters of the lake to foam,
tearing at Donald’s cabin with the strength of
invisible giant hands, and howling through the
forest with shrieking wails. Gust came upon
gust with increasing strength, and in the short
lulls could be heard the swish of the sleety snow
against the windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big trees creaked as they swayed in the
gale, and with a loud groan, as if in mortal pain,
a huge forest monarch, as its roots gave way,
fell crushing down the smaller trees to smite the
earth with a resounding crash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind went down through the night, but
the snow fell steadily. When Donald opened
his door next morning he looked out on a new
world. The wizardry of frost and snow had
given the earth a blanket of white that was
eye-blinding in its brilliancy under the bright
morning sun. The keen frost had locked the
lake tight under a coating of clear ice.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='lead-in'>With</span> a fond hope that he would receive word
of the Wainwrights, Donald eagerly awaited
the coming of each mail; but after a month of
disappointment he became less sanguine, and
threw himself desperately into work in a vain
attempt to allay his heartache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the long winter the mill continued
operations in spite of heavy snows, the roads
being kept open by the continual traffic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet came twice with gay parties to enjoy
the ski-ing and snowshoeing. She found that
she loved Donald, and decided that any uncertainty
as to his past was as nothing when
weighed against her need of him. Bitterly she
reproached herself for allowing her pride to
estrange him from her, and with all the arts of
a beautiful and cultured woman she sought to
regain the power she once held over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On one occasion, when Janet mentioned his
“wood-sprite,” she saw a rapt look in his eyes
and caught her breath sharply. The very
thought of losing him stabbed her like a knife-thrust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the coming of March a change came over
the earth. Winter shivered and reluctantly
loosed his hold. Gentle showers and warm
winds from the south honeycombed the ice
on the lake; snowdrifts faded away, and the
frost-bound soil gave forth earthy odours to
replace the keen smell of the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning a song-sparrow under Donald’s
window sent out its sweet “chip-chip-che-char-che-wiss-wiss,”
and from the top of a
swaying alder a wren carolled his joy of living
in full-throated tones that said that spring was
here. Stirred by the warmth and cleaving
buds, the frogs came from the mud, where they
had lain dormant all winter, and with swelling
throats and bulging cheeks sent out their cheerful
“k’tun, k’chunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mists covered the lake, and in an open spot
near the mouth of the creek a flock of ducks
disported themselves happily. The sun grew
higher with every dawn, gaining strength each
day until its warming energy spread the beauty
of colour and fragrance over all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One afternoon, when the air pulsated with the
song of birds, and newly-opened buds burdened
the atmosphere with perfume, Donald walked
up the hill to Wainwright’s cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scores of birds, returned from their yearly
pilgrimage to the south, flitted about the
deserted buildings, but there was no golden-haired
girl with a welcoming smile to greet
them. Rivulets from the melting snows had
gouged channels in the once neatly kept plots
of wild flowers, and the roof of one of the smaller
huts had fallen in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald pushed open the door of the main
building and entered. The air felt chill and
dank. He experienced a quick depression of
spirits, and his heart ached as he surveyed the
gloomy interior. He shivered as a pack-rat
scuttled across the floor and disappeared under
Connie’s bunk. With a heavy heart he returned
to the bright sunshine, sat down, and gave himself
over to a period of melancholy retrospection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mind went back to his first meeting with
Connie, then on through the many thrilling
episodes of the summer. She belonged to high
mountains, to deep forest glades, to companionship
with the birds, flowers and trees of
God’s wild outdoors. She would never be
content with the bad air and the cramped conventions
of cities. He suddenly remembered
the words she had used that day by the stream
near her nest in the cedars. He seemed to
hear her sweet, hesitating voice with its pleasant
English accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” she had said, “six months out of
every year I’d come right here and live in these
mountains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll come back,” he said aloud. The
thought cheered him. “She’ll come back,”
he repeated to Andy that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ’ope so, Donnie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week later, Robert Rennie, accompanied by
his daughter, arrived at Summit Lake. The
owner was in high spirits. “I am pleased with
the excellent work you are doing here,” he said,
as he placed a hand in friendly fashion on
Donald’s arm. “The mill is a success—a huge
success—and I know who deserves the greater
share of the credit!” He smiled up at Donald.
“Next week,” he went on, “an event of importance
to the lumber industry takes place. The
Government is to entertain a party of Eastern
lumbermen. I will admit that I was proud when
the chief forester called at my office to tell me
that this mill had been selected as the most
modern and efficient in the Province, and
requested permission to bring the Government’s
guests here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are to stay here a few days, but you
will not be inconvenienced, as the train will
be equipped with dining and sleeping-cars,
loaned for the occasion by the C.P.R. I will
come with them, but I am leaving it to you to
arrange for their entertainment and to see that
everything is in tip-top shape for their arrival.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Robert Rennie was leaving the next morning
he turned to Donald. “By the way,” he
said casually, “I have decided to add a yearly
bonus to your salary, based on the profits of this
mill. I have made it retroactive from the time
you took charge.” Before Donald had time to
express his thanks his employer swung aboard
the train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Expressing a desire to be at the lake on the
arrival of the excursion, Janet remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day set for the visit of the Eastern
capitalists the sun rose in radiant promise of a
typical June day. The leaves were now fully
matured, and the willows and maples rustled
under the soft, warm winds. All the valley was
clothed in a verdant, quivering, gently pulsating
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long train drew slowly into the depot.
Its occupants poured out until the small platform
was filled to overcrowding. Robert Rennie,
accompanied by a slender man dressed in a
tweed suit and cap, pushed his way through the
crowd to Donald’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald greeted his employer, then glanced
casually at Mr. Rennie’s companion. His eyes
widened. “Mr. Wainwright!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wainwright laughed happily as he wrung
Donald’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is—is Con—Miss Wainwright with you?”
stuttered Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he saw her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie had rehearsed this moment a thousand
times. She stood quietly on the steps for a
moment, then slipped gracefully to the platform,
Connie herself could not have imagined how
changed she was. From coiffure to dainty
French heels she was dressed as if fresh from
the hands of an expert Parisian costumer. So
dazzling was she that she positively took Donald’s
breath away. It seemed to him that she had
grown like a magic rose, all at once from a tiny
bud to a full blossom. No fault could be found
with the perfect oval of her face, or with the
delicate white rose skin, from which every trace
of tan had gone. The long lashes that fringed
her big blue eyes had turned a shade darker than
the curling waves of her abundant golden hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy, whose small form had been hidden in
the rear, moved bashfully forward, fumbling the
wide hat held in his hand. “ ’Ello, Connie,” he
blurted, his lips parted in a wide smile of
welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly Connie forgot her assumed dignity
and became her warm, impulsive little self. With
a glad cry she flung her arms about Andy’s neck
and kissed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me pink!” breathed Andy, as his
hand stole up to touch the spot where Connie’s
lips had brushed his cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie turned to face the lake. “Oh, Dad!”
she cried in ecstasy, “isn’t it good to be back
here again?” She stretched her arms toward
the ice-clad peaks. A gentle breeze swept down
the wooded slope to fan her face as though in
welcome. The blood surged beneath her smooth
white skin and went singing through every vein.
“Ah!” she sighed happily, as she inhaled a deep
breath of air laden with the odour of pine from
the hills she loved. Donald, gazing at her
hungrily, saw tears brimming under her long
lashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the far end of the train a tall, grey-haired
man assisted a slender sweet-faced woman to the
ground, and then walked towards the station.
As they stepped to the platform the woman’s
eyes rested on Donald, who stood with his back
to her. Instantly she became rooted to the
spot, eyes wide, one hand fluttering toward her
heart. With the supreme, wondrous mother-love
shining in her eyes, she held out her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donald!” she cried passionately, “Donald!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald whirled at the sound of the loved voice
calling his name. His heart throbbed wildly,
his throat felt constricted and his face paled
under stress of strong emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His arms were around his mother, yearning,
tender, hungry, after these long months of
separation. Her face upturned to his was white
and drawn, but her eyes shone with hallowed
joy. He felt his hand gripped in his father’s
strong fingers, and saw his eyes shining with tears.
John McLean patted his boy’s dark head with a
shaking hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donnie! My boy, Donnie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time Donald was oblivious to all
save the great happiness of meeting his parents.
His mother’s embrace almost unmanned him,
and it was with difficulty that he kept back the
sobs that tightened his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led his parents to the other end of the
platform and introduced them to his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Rennie’s comments were simply gasps
and a reiterated, “Well! Well!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy offered his usual contribution. “Strike
me pink!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie’s eyes were filled with soft eagerness as
she greeted Donald’s mother. The glow in
Donald’s face as he spoke to Connie was poignantly
significant of his deep love for her. But
Connie, to his consternation and dismay, met his
ardent glances with a look of cold indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since Connie’s arrival Janet’s features held a
look of disquietude, but she acknowledged the
introduction to Donald’s parents with a radiant
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later, Connie, with skirts held high,
was running down the railroad track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going after her horse,” smiled Wainwright
in answer to Donald’s question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you have dinner with us?” invited
Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, thank you,” responded Wainwright.
“We will sleep in the car to-night,” he continued,
“but Constance insists that we must return to
the old home as soon as possible. She has been
busy drawing plans for a chalet she intends
building on the bluff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie returned with the old trapper, the
latter leading Pegasus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At dinner Connie showed no signs of her
former shyness. She was as self-possessed,
calm and perfectly poised as a goddess. A glad
light filled her eyes as Gillis and his crew of
“redshirts” filed into the big dining-room.
She sprang to her feet and greeted them joyfully,
shaking hands with each and everyone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad to see you, Jack,” she smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big logger took her tiny hand in his.
“We’re sure glad to have you with us agin,
Connie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I bring Andy in to dine with us, Mr.
McLean?” she asked as she came back to the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald nodded assent. She ran gleefully to
the kitchen, and a moment later the loggers
grinned broadly as she came through the door
leading the protesting cook by the arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” she said as Andy sat down, “we’re all
here.” She looked about her and clasped her
hands rapturously. “It seems as though I had
been gone for years. And oh, it is so nice to
be home again!” She sank to a chair between
Andy and the trapper. “Do you remember,
Andy, when you were dressed as a butler and
danced with John at your party?” She threw
back her golden head and her silvery laughter
filled the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet was unhappy from the moment of
Connie’s arrival. She had caught the look of
adoration in Donald’s eyes as Connie stepped to
the station platform. Standing there then she
had quite definitely abandoned any hope of
winning him. And Janet had been so sure that
once she had held a place in his heart. A great
depression, a great weariness of spirit, settled
upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening, as Donald walked with his
parents by the lake-shore, he turned to his
father. “Dad,” he said anxiously, “do you
think I have made good? Will you forgive me
for—for——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John McLean’s eyes grew suddenly misty.
“Donnie,” he began gently, “Mr. Rennie has
told us all about you. And no man could speak
more highly of another.” He drew a newspaper
from his pocket. “Haven’t you seen this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Vancouver’s morning paper, with a full-page
devoted to the visit of the Eastern lumbermen.
There were several photographs of the
Summit Mill and one of Donald. The paper
spoke of him as “the able young engineer whose
modern ideas and energy had given to British
Columbia a logging plant and mill that were a
credit to the Province.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald saw the proud light in his father’s
eyes, and his heart was filled with a great peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day carpenters and material arrived
for the construction of Wainwright’s new home.
That afternoon Connie, clad in fashionable
riding habit, came to the mill office with her
foreman to place an order for lumber. Pegasus
in silver-mounted bridle and English saddle was
proudly restive. With neck arched he curvetted
and rocked while Connie sat on his back with
that complete lack of self-consciousness that is
the heritage of a born horsewoman. Before
leaving she rode up the hill among the toiling
workers, her irresistible smile bringing an
answering grin from the “redshirts,” who doffed
their big hats and shouted a joyous greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All day pack-horses and men struggled up the
hill, staggering under the weight of building
material. But although Donald strained his
eyes for a glimpse of the golden-haired rider, he
saw her no more that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As dusk fell over lake and mountain, Donald
returned from Wainwright’s cabin. Andy
glanced up expectantly as his friend appeared,
but quickly averted his face as he saw the look
of settled melancholy shrouding Donald’s features.
Donald sank disconsolately to a seat
outside the kitchen door. He had found Wainwright
alone and wondered if Connie had
purposely absented herself. Her treatment of
him since her return puzzled him sorely and
had filled him with a great despondency. As
he rose and walked toward his cabin, Andy
gazed after the retreating figure, eyes filled with
compassion, then turned to speak to one of his
helpers in such an irritable tone that the flunkey’s
mouth opened in astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For three evenings it was the same. Donald
failed to find Connie at home; nor did she come
to the mill. He regretfully decided that it was
no coincidence, but that she was deliberately
avoiding him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a Sunday afternoon Andy saw Donald
gaze yearningly toward the bluff, then turn up
the trail leading to the dam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Donald’s request Gillis had diverted logging
operations to circle the little oasis in the heavy
timber, so that Connie’s sylvan glade still held
its primeval charm and beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald stood for a moment gazing reflectively
into the white foam at the foot of the tiny cataract,
then threw himself on the soft bed of moss
and closed his eyes. But this time the fairy spot
did not bring the usual delicious languor to his
harassed spirit. Birds sang as sweetly; flowers
filled the air with the same odour; the wind
sighed as softly through the tree-tops, and the
small brook still sang its rippling song. The
rapid tattoo of a woodpecker’s bill on a hollow
tree jarred his nerves and he tossed restlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cedar tip floated through the air. Blown by
the wind, it fluttered in circles, then landed gently
on the hands lying on his chest. His eyes opened,
then, with trembling limbs he came to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie, clad in faded overalls and cotton
shirt, stood on the edge of the “nest.” Her
breast was heaving, her loosened golden hair
flying in the wind. The softness in her blue
eyes made Donald gasp, and his heart thumped
as though it were in his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Connie!” he cried huskily, “I love you, dear!
Don’t you care for me even a little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sprang lightly to the ground and came
toward him, her arms outstretched. Tears of
joy coursed down her cheeks. “Oh, Donald,
Donald, you big stupid!” she sobbed, “I have
been waiting here for you every day. I—I have
loved you always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a shock of incredible rapture Donald
gathered her in his strong arms, where she
cuddled like a weeping child. He kissed her
red lips, her eyes, hair and throbbing throat.
“My little Connie,” he said, in a voice vibrant
with feeling, “do you really love me?” He
pressed his cheek to hers and felt the flutter of
her long lashes as she pressed the softness of
her own closer. The quick, exquisite indrawing
of her sobbing breath were lovely answering
things, and he thrilled to hear her whisper:
“Yes, Donald! Yes, Donald!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy came walking meditatively up the path,
his hands clasped behind him, his blond head
bowed in deep thought. Not finding Donald
at the dam, he walked up the hill to enter the
meadow just as Donald clasped Connie in his
arms. For an instant the little Australian stood
rigid, his eyes bulging, then retreated hastily to
the shelter of the trees. Anyone seeing Andy
at that moment would have thought him suddenly
gone mad. He whirled about in a wild
dance, hugging himself in an ecstasy of joy.
Ceasing his mad gyrations, he dashed his hand
across his eyes and bolted like a runaway down
the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gillis and his “redshirts” sat sunning themselves
on the steps of the dining-room. They
sprang to their feet as Andy came tearing down
the hill. Breathlessly Andy told them of the
scene he had witnessed. “We’ll give them a
blinkin’ good reception when they come down,”
he panted. He issued several sharp orders
and the men scurried happily to execute his
commands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train that was to carry the excursionists to
the Coast was being made up on the siding.
While they were awaiting this, the visitors
watched with curious interest the mysterious
preparations being made by the loggers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment, hand in hand, Donald and
Connie turned the corner of the building.
As they did so they came to a sudden halt and
stared at the odd scene before them. The
men stood in two orderly rows. The ground
between was carpeted with wild flowers, and
each logger held a mass of blooms in his hand.
At the far end of this lane of men stood Andy,
a wide smile on his droll face. Connie lowered
her eyes in confusion. Donald shook his fist
at Andy. “You little beggar! You are responsible
for this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy chuckled. “Come on, Donnie, be a
sport,” he coaxed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With flushed faces Donald and Connie walked
down the aisle, while the men pelted them with
flowers. The crowd of visitors clapped their
hands in appreciation of this beautiful scene.
As they neared the end of the gauntlet, Andy
sprang to a stump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three cheers for the ’appy couple!” he
yelled. A roar of cheering followed. “A
tiger!” shouted Andy. And again the air
trembled to the hoarse shout of brawny
throats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald led Connie straight to his mother.
“Mother,” he said bashfully, “meet your
future daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quick tears came to his mother’s eyes as
Donald made this announcement. “My dear,”
she said tenderly, as her arms folded about
Connie, “you are all love and tenderness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train’s whistle screeched its warning
and the crowd moved down to the station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you be coming home to us soon,
Donnie?” asked his father as he was leaving.
Donald looked down at Connie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll visit you on our honeymoon, Dad,”
responded Donald happily. He swept his arm
toward the mountains. “I could never leave
this. The spell of the Great West has entered
my blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet had spent the afternoon paddling idly
on the lake. When she received the news of
Donald’s engagement she concealed the ache
in her heart by an outward air of indifference.
The pretence of a headache enabled her to
keep in her cabin and she did not appear for
dinner. She wanted to be alone with her
thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the shadows lengthened, Donald and
Connie moved slowly along the path toward the
bluff. As they turned a curve in the trail
Janet came to the window of her cabin and stood
watching them until they disappeared from
sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy, sitting a few feet distant with his back
against a tree, noted the look of despondency
on Janet’s face. He came to his feet and walked
slowly toward the kitchen. “As Methusalem
said through ’is whiskers, ‘ ’e who ’olds ’is
’ead too ’igh will ’t ’is blinkin’ toe.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the lovers were about to turn up the
mountain trail, the trapper emerged from the
woods with his old pack-horse. The cayuse was
piled high with luggage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you going, John?” queried
Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m hittin’ the trail, ol’ timer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you are not leaving us,” said Connie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’m quittin’ the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” questioned Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gittin’ too thickly settled. I feel that I ain’t
got room to breathe. I’m goin’ way back into
the Cariboo somewhere so’s I kin be by myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The race of mediæval hermits is not dead.
The spirit that led the first pioneers into the
forest guides others there to-day. There are
men whose souls long for a place untamed, who
yearn to breathe the wild free air. They want
a home straight from the hands of the Creator,
unspoiled by man. They may be trappers, who
brave cold and hardships to clothe milady in
warm furs; they may be prospectors, who search
out the hidden gold for others to use. Whatever
they may be, these hardy men blaze the
trail for others to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Donald told the trapper of the coming
wedding the old man’s eyes softened. “I’m
glad. It’s jest right. I hoped you two would
git married.” He shook hands gravely, then
clucked to his horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Connie! Good-bye, ol’ timer!
God bless ye!” he shouted over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald and Connie stood watching the patient
old figure as he trudged behind his cayuse. At
a turn of the trail he stopped and for a long
interval gazed back at the log cabin by the
stream, which had been his home for so many
years. He waved his hand in farewell, then
horse and man disappeared from view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Donald and Connie reached the bluff
the sun had sunk in the crimson west, leaving a
rich afterglow that spread across the horizon
from west to east, the rich colours merging by
slow degrees into that pure pearl-grey which
makes the long and lovely twilight of the British
Columbia mountains. Down on the lake mists
were gathering, but in the upper sky and on the
glaciers a vivid orange glow still lingered. The
trees stood stiff and motionless in the quiet air.
From afar, subdued but clear, came the hoot of
a blue-grouse, and from mountain gorges came
the faint sighing sound of distant waterfalls.
Sweet and pungent odours of wild flowers came
from the woods about them. A star of silver
brilliancy sparkled suddenly out in the sky over
the massive snow-clad peaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Venus,” whispered Connie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s gaze swept from the camp, nestled
at their feet, to the darkening heavens, to the
star of love, then down to the girl by his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are moments in the lives of all men—regardless
of creed or religion—when they feel
the nearness of God. Such a moment came to
Donald. He uttered no sound, yet his soul was
crying out its great thankfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Connie sensed his feeling. She bowed her
head, her eyes misty with joy and gratitude.
“Oh, God,” she murmured softly, “we thank
Thee for Thy many blessings.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
